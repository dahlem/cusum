    abstract = {Electronic health record ({EHR}) data show promise for deriving new ways of modeling human disease states. Although {EHR} researchers often use numerical values of laboratory tests as features in disease models, a great deal of information is contained in the context within which a laboratory test is taken. For example, the same numerical value of a creatinine test has different interpretation for a chronic kidney disease patient and a patient with acute kidney injury. We study whether {EHR} research studies are subject to biased results and interpretations if laboratory measurements taken in different contexts are not explicitly separated. We show that the context of a laboratory test measurement can often be captured by the way the test is measured through time. We perform three tasks to study the properties of these temporal measurement patterns. In the first task, we confirm that laboratory test measurement patterns provide additional information to the stand-alone numerical value. The second task identifies three measurement pattern motifs across a set of 70 laboratory tests performed for over 14,000 patients. Of these, one motif exhibits properties that can lead to biased research results. In the third task, we demonstrate the potential for biased results on a specific example. We conduct an association study of lipase test values to acute pancreatitis. We observe a diluted signal when using only a lipase value threshold, whereas the full association is recovered when properly accounting for lipase measurements in different contexts (leveraging the lipase measurement patterns to separate the contexts). Aggregating {EHR} data without separating distinct laboratory test measurement patterns can intermix patients with different diseases, leading to the confounding of signals in large-scale {EHR} analyses. This paper presents a methodology for leveraging measurement frequency to identify and reduce laboratory test biases. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {The study of utilization patterns can quantify potential overuse of laboratory tests and find new ways to reduce healthcare costs. We demonstrate the use of distributional analytics for comparing electronic health record ({EHR}) laboratory test orders across time to diagnose and quantify overutilization. We looked at hemoglobin A1c ({HbA1c}) testing across 119,000 patients and 15 years of hospital records. We examined the patterns of {HbA1c} ordering before and after the publication of the 2002 American Diabetes Association guidelines for {HbA1c} testing. We conducted analyses to answer three questions. What are the patterns of {HbA1c} ordering? Do {HbA1c} orders follow the guidelines with respect to frequency of measurement? If not, how and why do they depart from the guidelines? The raw number of {HbA1c} orderings has steadily increased over time, with a specific increase in low-measurement orderings (<6.5\%). There is a change in ordering pattern following the 2002 guideline (p<0.001). However, by comparing ordering distributions, we found that the changes do not reflect the guidelines and rather exhibit a new practice of rapid-repeat testing. The rapid-retesting phenomenon does not follow the 2009 guidelines for diabetes diagnosis either, illustrated by a stratified {HbA1c} value analysis. Results suggest {HbA1c} test overutilization, and contributing factors include lack of care coordination, unexpected values prompting retesting, and point-of-care tests followed by confirmatory laboratory tests. We present a method of comparing ordering distributions in an {EHR} across time as a useful diagnostic approach for identifying and assessing the trend of inappropriate use over time.

The perspective is useful theoretically, computationally, and conceptually. Mathematically, we prove that the excess entropy—a familiar measure of organization in complex systems—is the mutual information not only between the past and future, but also between the predictive and retrodictive causal states. Practically, we exploit the connection between prediction and retrodiction to directly calculate the excess entropy. Conceptually, these lead one to discover new system measures for stochastic dynamical systems: crypticity (information accessibility) and causal irreversibility. Ultimately, we introduce a time-symmetric representation that unifies all of these quantities, compressing the two directional representations into one. The resulting compression offers a new conception of the amount of information stored in the present.},

    abstract = {{Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are currently employed in a wide variety of applications, including speech recognition, target tracking, and protein sequence analysis. The Viterbi algorithm is perhaps the best known method for tracking the hidden states of a process from a sequence of observations. An important problem when tracking a process with an HMM is estimating the uncertainty present in the solution. In this correspondence, an algorithm for computing at runtime the entropy of the possible hidden state sequences that may have produced a certain sequence of observations is introduced. The brute-force computation of this quantity requires a number of calculations exponential in the length of the observation sequence. This algorithm, however, is based on a trellis structure resembling that of the Viterbi algorithm, and permits the efficient computation of the entropy with a complexity linear in the number of observations.}},

    abstract = {{A common query against large protein and gene sequence data sets is to locate targets that are similar to an input query sequence. The current set of popular search tools, such as BLAST, employ heuristics to improve the speed of such searches. However, such heuristics can sometimes miss targets, which in many cases is undesirable. The alternative to BLAST is to use an accurate algorithm, such as the Smith-Waterman (S-W) algorithm. However, these accurate algorithms are computationally very expensive, which limits their use in practice. This paper takes on the challenge of designing an accurate and efficient algorithm for evaluating local-alignment searches. To meet this goal, we propose a novel search algorithm, called OASIS. This algorithm employs a dynamic programming A*-search driven by a suffix-tree index that is built on the input data set. We experimentally evaluate OASIS and demonstrate that for an important class of searches, in which the query sequence lengths are small, OASIS is more than an order of magnitude faster than S-W. In addition, the speed of OASIS is comparable to BLAST. Furthermore, OASIS returns results in decreasing order of the matching score, making it possible to use OASIS in an online setting. Consequently, we believe that it may now be practically feasible to query large biological sequence data sets using an accurate local-alignment search algorithm.}},

    abstract = {{The author describes a method of comparing sequences of characters,called sequence alignment or string matching, and illustrates its use in the analysis of daily activity patterns derived from time-use diaries. It allows definition of measures of similarity or distance between complete sequences, called global alignment, or the evaluation of the best fit of short sequences within long?sequences, called local alignment. Alignments may be done pairwise to develop similarity or distance matrices that describe the relatedness of individuals in the set of sequences being examined. Pairwise alignment methods may be extended to many individuals by using multiple alignment analysis. A number of elementary hand-worked examples are provided. The basic concepts are discussed in terms of the problems of time-use research and the method is illustrated by examining diary data from a survey conducted in Reading, England. The CLUSTAL software used for the alignments was written for molecular biological research. The method offers a powerful technique for analyzing the full richness of diary data without discarding the details of episode ordering, duration, or transition. It is also possible to extend the analysis to include the context of activities, such as the presence of other persons or the location, but such extensions would require software designed for social science rather than biochemical problems. The method also offers a challenge to researchers to begin to develop theories about the determinants of daily behavior as a whole, rather than about participation in single activities or about time-budget totals.}},

@book{citeulike:5208590,
    abstract = {{Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student, the new second
edition of \_Introduction to Algorithms\_ builds on the tradition of the
original with a truly magisterial guide to the world of algorithms. Clearly
presented, mathematically rigorous, and yet approachable even for the maths-
averse, this title sets a high standard for a textbook and reference to the
best algorithms for solving a wide range of computing problems.

With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of
each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its
reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job at explaining each
algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help
readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some maths background to
appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every
algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any
computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one
of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures,
from basic linked list to trees (including binary trees, red-black and
B-trees), this title really shines with clear diagrams that show algorithms in
operation. Even if you glance over the mathematical notation here, you can
definitely benefit from this text in other ways.

The book moves forward with more advanced algorithms that implement strategies
for solving more complicated problems (including dynamic programming
techniques, greedy algorithms, and amortised analysis). Algorithms for
graphing problems (used in such real-world business problems as optimising
flight schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the
authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along with
sample solutions.

This text closes with a grab bag of useful algorithms including matrix
operations and linear programming, evaluating polynomials and the well-known
Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) (useful in signal processing and
engineering). Final sections on "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known
traveloling salesmen problem, show off that while not all problems have a
demonstrably final and best answer, algorithms that generate acceptable
approximate solutions can still be used to generate useful, real-world
answers.

Throughout this text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with
current examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome project),
business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of related
historical material often discussing original research in each area of
algorithms. In all, they argue successfully that algorithms are a "technology"
just like hardware and software that can be used to write better software that
does more with better performance. Along with classic books on algorithms
(like Donald Knuth's three-volume set, \_The Art of Computer Programming\_),
this title sets a new standard for compiling the best research in algorithms.
For any experienced developer, regardless of their chosen language, this text
deserves a close look for extending the range and performance of real-world
software. \_--Richard Dragan\_}},

@incollection{citeulike:8494209,
    abstract = {{A central goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on several methods to speed-up both training and probability computation, as well as comparative experiments to evaluate the improvements brought by these techniques. We finally describe the incorporation of this new language model into a state-of-the-art speech recognizer of conversational speech.}},

In studying data from more than 1.6 million patient histories at the University of Michigan Health system we quickly realized that frequent sequences, while providing one level of data reduction, still constitute a serious analytical challenge as many involve alternate serializations of the same sets of codes. To further analyze these sequences, we designed an approach where a partial order is mined from frequent sequences of codes. We demonstrate an EMR mining system called EMRView that enables exploration of the precedence relationships to quickly identify and visualize partial order information encoded in key classes of patients. We demonstrate some important nuggets learned through our approach and also outline key challenges for future research based on our experiences.}},

Although several methods have been used, their suitability has been on empirical evaluation rather than a well-founded model. The authors propose the application of a Poisson process model of novelty. Its ability to predict novel tokens is evaluated, and it consistently outperforms existing methods. It is applied to a practical statistical coding scheme, where a slight modification is required to avoid divergence. The result is a well-founded zero-frequency model that explains observed differences in the performance of existing methods, and offers a small improvement in the coding efficiency of text compression over the best method previously known}},

    abstract = {{The eligibility trace is one of the basic mechanisms used in reinforcement learning to handle delayed reward. In this paper we introduce a new kind of eligibility trace, thereplacing trace, analyze it theoretically, and show that it results in faster, more reliable learning than the conventional trace. Both kinds of trace assign credit to prior events according to how recently they occurred, but only the conventional trace gives greater credit to repeated events. Our analysis is for conventional and replace-trace versions of the offline TD(1) algorithm applied to undiscounted absorbing Markov chains. First, we show that these methods converge under repeated presentations of the training set to the same predictions as two well known Monte Carlo methods. We then analyze the relative efficiency of the two Monte Carlo methods. We show that the method corresponding to conventional TD is biased, whereas the method corresponding to replace-trace TD is unbiased. In addition, we show that the method corresponding to replacing traces is closely related to the maximum likelihood solution for these tasks, and that its mean squared error is always lower in the long run. Computational results confirm these analyses and show that they are applicable more generally. In particular, we show that replacing traces significantly improve performance and reduce parameter sensitivity on the "Mountain-Car" task, a full reinforcement-learning problem with a continuous state space, when using a feature-based function approximator.}},

    abstract = {{Most severe disasters cause large population movements. These movements make it difficult for relief organizations to efficiently reach people in need. Understanding and predicting the locations of affected people during disasters is key to effective humanitarian relief operations and to long-term societal reconstruction. We collaborated with the largest mobile phone operator in Haiti (Digicel) and analyzed the movements of 1.9 million mobile phone users during the period from 42 d before, to 341 d after the devastating Haiti earthquake of January 12, 2010. Nineteen days after the earthquake, population movements had caused the population of the capital Port-au-Prince to decrease by an estimated 23\%. Both the travel distances and size of people's movement trajectories grew after the earthquake. These findings, in combination with the disorder that was present after the disaster, suggest that people's movements would have become less predictable. Instead, the predictability of people's trajectories remained high and even increased slightly during the three-month period after the earthquake. Moreover, the destinations of people who left the capital during the first three weeks after the earthquake was highly correlated with their mobility patterns during normal times, and specifically with the locations in which people had significant social bonds. For the people who left Port-au-Prince, the duration of their stay outside the city, as well as the time for their return, all followed a skewed, fat-tailed distribution. The findings suggest that population movements during disasters may be significantly more predictable than previously thought.}},

    abstract = {{Discrete event simulation systems (DESS) are widely used in many diverse areas such as computer-communication networks, flexible manufacturing systems, project evaluation and review techniques (PERT), and flow networks. Because of their complexity, such systems are typically analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation methods. This paper deals with optimization of complex computer simulation models involving rare events. A classic example is to find an optimal ( s ,  S ) policy in a multi-item, multicommodity inventory system, when quality standards require the backlog probability to be extremely small. Our approach is based on change of the probability measure techniques, also called likelihood ratio (LR) and importance sampling (IS) methods. Unfortunately, for arbitrary probability measures the LR estimators and the resulting optimal solution often tend to be unstable and may have large variances. Therefore, the choice of the corresponding importance sampling distribution and in particular its parameters in an optimal way is an important task. We consider the case where the IS distribution comes from the same parametric family as the original (true) one and use the  stochastic counterpart  method to handle simulation based optimization models. More specifically, we use a two-stage procedure: at the first stage we identify (estimate) the optimal parameter vector at the IS distribution, while at the second stage we estimate the optimal solution of the underlying constrained optimization problem. Particular emphasis will be placed on estimation of rare events and on integration of the associated performance function into stochastic optimization programs. Supporting numerical results are provided as well.}},

    abstract = {{We present some new results on the nonparametric estimation of entropy and mutual information. First, we use an exact local expansion of the entropy function to prove almost sure consistency and central limit theorems for three of the most commonly used discretized information estimators. The setup is related to Grenander's method of sieves and places no assumptions on the underlying probability measure generating the data. Second, we prove a converse to these consistency theorems, demonstrating that a misapplication of the most common estimation techniques leads to an arbitrarily poor estimate of the true information, even given unlimited data. This ?inconsistency? theorem leads to an analytical approximation of the bias, valid in surprisingly small sample regimes and more accurate than the usual formula of Miller and Madow over a large region of parameter space. The two most practical implications of these results are negative: (1) information estimates in a certain data regime are likely contaminated by bias, even if ?bias-corrected? estimators are used, and (2) confidence intervals calculated by standard techniques drastically underestimate the error of the most common estimation methods. Finally, we note a very useful connection between the bias of entropy estimators and a certain polynomial approximation problem. By casting bias calculation problems in this approximation theory framework, we obtain the best possible generalization of known asymptotic bias results. More interesting, this framework leads to an estimator with some nice properties: the estimator comes equipped with rigorous bounds on the maximum error over all possible underlying probability distributions, and this maximum error turns out to be surprisingly small. We demonstrate the application of this new estimator on both real and simulated data.}},

    abstract = {{The data mining community has derived a broad foundation of statistical algorithms and software solutions that has allowed predictive analytics to become a standard approach used in science and industry.For many years, much emphasis has been placed on the development of predictive models. As a consequence, the market place offers a range of powerful tools, many open-source, for effective model building. However, once we turn to the operational deployment and practical application of predictive solutions within an existing IT infrastructure, we face a much more limited choice of options. Often it takes months for models to be integrated and deployed via custom code or proprietary processes.The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard has reached a significant stage of maturity and has obtained broad industry support, allowing users to develop predictive solutions within one application and use another to execute them. Previously, this was very difficult, but with PMML, the exchange of predictive solutions between compliant applications is now straightforward.The aim of this book is to present PMML from a practical perspective. It contains a variety of code snippets so that concepts are made clear through the use of examples. Readers are assumed to have a basic knowledge of predictive analytics and its techniques and so the book is intended for data mining movers and shakers: anyone interested in moving predictive analytic solutions between applications, including students and scientists.PMML in Action is a great way to learn how to represent your predictive solutions through a mature and refined open standard. For the 2nd edition, the book has been completely revised for PMML 4.1, the latest version of PMML. It includes new chapters and an expanded description of how to represent multiple models in PMML, including model ensemble, segmentation, chaining, and composition. The book is divided into six parts, taking you in a PMML journey in which language elements and attributes are used to represent not only modeling techniques but also data pre- and post-processing.With PMML, users benefit from a single and concise standard to represent predictive models, thus avoiding the need for custom code and proprietary solutions.You too can join the PMML movement!

@article{citeulike:9643820,
    abstract = {{This paper uses the method of kinematic waves, developed in part I, but may be read independently. A functional relationship between flow and concentration for traffic on crowded arterial roads has been postulated for some time, and has experimental backing (section 2). From this a theory of the propagation of changes in traffic distribution along these roads may be deduced (section section 2, 3). The theory is applied (section 4) to the problem of estimating how a 'hump', or region of increased concentration, will move along a crowded main road. It is suggested that it will move slightly slower than the mean vehicle speed, and that vehicles passing through it will have to reduce speed rather suddenly (at a 'shock wave') on entering it, but can increase speed again only very gradually as they leave it. The hump gradually spreads out along the road, and the time scale of this process is estimated. The behaviour of such a hump on entering a bottleneck, which is too narrow to admit the increased flow, is studied (section 5), and methods are obtained for estimating the extent and duration of the resulting hold-up. The theory is applicable principally to traffic behaviour over a long stretch of road, but the paper concludes (section 6) with a discussion of its relevance to problems of flow near junctions, including a discussion of the starting flow at a controlled junction. In the introductory sections 1 and 2, we have included some elementary material on the quantitative study of traffic flow for the benefit of scientific readers unfamiliar with the subject.}},

The research question of whether similar findings would hold in the larger context of a city for a long period of time is still open. To tackle this research question, we have gathered the complete dataset of the most popular neighbourhood online forum in Dublin. In this dataset, we have people sharing a common purpose (blocs) who live in the same neighbourhood and interact online to ask for help, engage in local activities, and, more generally, have a better understanding of their physical community. Our analysis highlights the particularly concentrated usage in newly established developments where a pre-existing community may be absent.

    abstract = {{This dissertation develops and evaluates a new adaptive traffic signal control system for arterials. This control system is based on reinforcement learning, which is an important research area in distributed artificial intelligence and has been extensively used in many applications including real-time control. In this dissertation, a systematic comparison between the reinforcement learning control methods and existing adaptive traffic control methods is first presented from the theoretical perspective. This comparison shows both the connections between them and the benefits of using reinforcement learning. A Neural-Fuzzy Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning (NFACRL) method is then introduced for traffic signal control. NFACRL integrates fuzzy logic and neural networks into reinforcement learning and can better handle the curse of dimensionality and generalization problems associated with ordinary reinforcement learning methods. This NFACRL method is first applied to isolated intersection control. Two different implementation schemes are considered. The first scheme uses a fixed phase sequence and variable cycle length, while the second one optimizes phase sequence in real time and is not constrained to the concept of cycle. Both schemes are further extended for arterial control, with each intersection being controlled by one NFACRL controller. Different strategies used for coordinating reinforcement learning controllers are reviewed, and a simple but robust method is adopted for coordinating traffic signals along the arterial. The proposed NFACRL control system is tested at both isolated intersection and arterial levels based on VISSIM simulation. The testing is conducted under different traffic volume scenarios using real-world traffic data collected during morning, noon, and afternoon peak periods. The performance of the NFACRL control system is compared with that of the optimized pre-timed and actuated control. Testing results based on VISSIM simulation show that the proposed NFACRL control has very promising performance. It outperforms optimized pre-timed and actuated control in most cases for both isolated intersection and arterial control. At the end of this dissertation, issues on how to further improve the NFACRL method and implement it in real world are discussed.}},

Depending on the detected traffic patterns, one can select the control objective to be either minimizing the total travel time or maximizing the total throughput over the target area. The solution procedures developed with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been tested with an example arterial of four intersections under different demand scenarios. Extensive experimental analyses in comparison with results from TRANSYT-7F (version 8) reveal that the proposed model and solution method are quite promising for use in design of arterial signals, especially under congested, high demand traffic conditions.}},

An alternative, novel methodology consists of an open-loop constrained quadratic optimal control problem, whose numerical solution is achieved via quadratic programming. Yet a different formulation leads to an open-loop constrained nonlinear optimal control problem, whose numerical solution is achieved by use of a feasible-direction algorithm.

The controller aims for three operational objectives: dynamic allocation of green time, automatic adjustment to control parameters, and fast revision of signal plans. The control algorithm is built on approximate dynamic programming (ADP). This approach substantially reduces computational burden by using an approximation to the value function of the dynamic programming and reinforcement learning to update the approximation. We investigate temporal-difference learning and perturbation learning as specific learning techniques for the ADP approach. We find in computer simulation that the ADP controllers achieve substantial reduction in vehicle delays in comparison with optimised fixed-time plans. Our results show that substantial benefits can be gained by increasing the frequency at which the signal plans are revised, which can be achieved conveniently using the ADP approach.}},

    abstract = {{"Transition" is simplistically defined as the process of switching from one timing plan to the next. Doing so can disrupt traffic flow to varying degrees, with potentially lasting effects. Avoiding or mitigating these effects is of particular interest in the context of more frequent timing plan changes, as may be expected under traffic-responsive or adaptive traffic control. This paper compares several transition methods, for each of several congestion levels, to determine which methods exhibit the least vehicle delay. A policy is introduced for dynamically selecting an effective transition method based on current traffic conditions. This study uses new transition capabilities recently added to the CORSIM simulation, based on current transition functionality of Eagle, Econolite, NextPhase, and Naztec controllers. Results confirmed that Shortway transition is the most effective in general, but also showed that under congested conditions, Add transition performed as well or better. Dwell transition exhibited higher delays. Evaluation of several parameter settings also demonstrated minor benefits to configuring more generous Add constraints and slightly more conservative Subtract constraints.}},

    abstract = {{Transportation network improvements are commonly evaluated by estimating average speeds from a transportation/traffic model and converting them into emission estimates using an environmental model such as MOBILE or EMFAC. Unfortunately, recent research has demonstrated that average speed, and perhaps even simple estimates of the amount of delay and the number of vehicle stops on a roadway, is insufficient to fully capture the environmental impacts of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) strategies such as adaptive traffic signal control. Specifically, for the same average speed, one can observe very disparate instantaneous speed and acceleration profiles, each resulting in very different fuel consumption and emission levels. In an attempt to address this limitation, this paper presents the INTEGRATION model framework for quantifying the environmental impacts of ITS alternatives. The model combines car-following, vehicle dynamics, lane changing, energy, and emission models to estimate mobile source emissions directly from instantaneous speed and acceleration levels. The validity of the model is shown using sample test scenarios that include traveling at a constant speed, traveling at variable speeds, stopping at a stop sign, and traveling along a signalized arterial. It is also demonstrated that an adjustment in driver aggressiveness can provide environmental benefits equivalent to the benefits of adaptive traffic signal control.}},

    abstract = {{The exponential growth of the internet has led to a great deal of interest in developing useful and efficient tools and software to assist users in searching the Web. Document retrieval, categorization, routing and filtering can all be formulated as classification problems. However, the complexity of natural languages and the extremely high dimensionality of the feature space of documents have made this classification problem very difficult. We investigate four different methods for document classification: the naive Bayes classifier, the nearest neighbour classifier, decision trees and a subspace method. These were applied to seven-class Yahoo news groups (business, entertainment, health, international, politics, sports and technology) individually and in combination. We studied three classifier combination approaches: simple voting, dynamic classifier selection and adaptive classifier combination. Our experimental results indicate that the naive Bayes classifier and the subspace method outperform the other two classifiers on our data sets. Combinations of multiple classifiers did not always improve the classification accuracy compared to the best individual classifier. Among the three different combination approaches, our adaptive classifier combination method introduced here performed the best. The best classification accuracy that we are able to achieve on this seven-class problem is approximately 83\%, which is comparable to the performance of other similar studies. However, the classification problem considered here is more difficult because the pattern classes used in our experiments have a large overlap of words in their corresponding documents.}},

Two algorithms based on the 'candidate list paradigm' first used by Waterman (1984) are presented. The first computes significantly more parsimonious candidate lists than Waterman's method. The second method refines the first to the point of guaranteeingO(N 2lgN) worst-case time complexity, and under certain conditionsO(N 2). Experimental data show how various properties of the comparison problem affect the methods' relative performance. A number of extensions are discussed, among them a technique for constructing optimal alignments inO(N) space in expectation.

Previous analyses have estimated the economic costs of congestion, related to fuel and time wasted, but few have quantified the public health impacts or determined how these impacts compare in magnitude to the economic costs. Moreover, the relative magnitudes of economic and public health impacts of congestion would be expected to vary significantly across urban areas, as a function of road infrastructure, population density, and atmospheric conditions influencing pollutant formation, but this variability has not been explored. In this study, we evaluate the public health impacts of ambient exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations associated with a business-as-usual scenario of predicted traffic congestion. We evaluate 83 individual urban areas using traffic demand models to estimate the degree of congestion in each area from 2000 to 2030. We link traffic volume and speed data with the MOBILE6 model to characterize emissions of PM2.5 and particle precursors attributable to congestion, and we use a source-receptor matrix to evaluate the impact of these emissions on ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Marginal concentration changes are related to a concentration-response function for mortality, with a value of statistical life approach used to monetize the impacts. We estimate that the monetized value of PM2.5-related mortality attributable to congestion in these 83 cities in 2000 was approximately \$31 billion (2007 dollars), as compared with a value of time and fuel wasted of \$60 billion. In future years, the economic impacts grow (to over \$100 billion in 2030) while the public health impacts decrease to \$13 billion in 2020 before increasing to \$17 billion in 2030, given increasing population and congestion but lower emissions per vehicle. Across cities and years, the public health impacts range from more than an order of magnitude less to in excess of the economic impacts. Our analyses indicate that the public health impacts of congestion may be significant enough in magnitude, at least in some urban areas, to be considered in future evaluations of the benefits of policies to mitigate congestion.}},

    abstract = {{Road traffic prediction is a critical component in modern smart transportation systems. It provides the basis for traffic management agencies to generate proactive traffic operation strategies for alleviating congestion. Existing work on near-term traffic prediction (forecasting horizons in the range of 5 minutes to 1 hour) relies on the past and current traffic conditions. However, once the forecasting horizon is beyond 1 hour, i.e., in longer-term traffic prediction, these techniques do not work well since additional factors other than the past and current traffic conditions start to play important roles. To address this problem, in this paper, for the first time, we examine whether it is possible to use the rich information in online social media to improve longer-term traffic prediction. To this end, we first analyze the correlation between traffic volume and tweet counts with various granularities. Then we propose an optimization framework to extract traffic indicators based on tweet semantics using a transformation matrix, and incorporate them into traffic prediction via linear regression. Experimental results using traffic and Twitter data originated from the San Francisco Bay area of California demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.}},

    abstract = {{We study how the Shannon entropy of sequences produced by an information source converges to the source's entropy rate. We synthesize several phenomenological approaches to applying information theoretic measures of randomness and memory to stochastic and deterministic processes by using successive derivatives of the Shannon entropy growth curve. This leads, in turn, to natural measures of apparent memory stored in a source and the amounts of information that must be extracted from observations of a source in order for it to be optimally predicted and for an observer to synchronize to it. To measure the difficulty of synchronization, we define the transient information and prove that, for Markov processes, it is related to the total uncertainty experienced while synchronizing to a process. One consequence of ignoring a process's structural properties is that the missed regularities are converted to apparent randomness. We demonstrate that this problem arises particularly for settings where one has access only to short measurement sequences. Numerically and analytically, we determine the Shannon entropy growth curve, and related quantities, for a range of stochastic and deterministic processes. We conclude by looking at the relationships between a process's entropy convergence behavior and its underlying computational structure.}},

The objective of this study is to determine whether it is possible to complement these sources of evidence with information about physician  ” group intelligence” that exists in electronic health records. Specifically, we measured laboratory test  ” repeat intervals”, defined as the amount of time it takes for a physician to repeat a test that was previously ordered for the same patient. Our assumption is that while the result of a test is a direct measure of one marker of a patient's health, the physician's decision to order the test is based on multiple factors including past experience, available treatment options, and information about the patient that might not be coded in the electronic health record. By examining repeat intervals in aggregate over large numbers of patients, we show that it is possible to 1) determine what laboratory test results physicians consider  ” normal”, 2) identify subpopulations of patients that deviate from the norm, and 3) identify situations where laboratory tests are over-ordered. We used laboratory tests as just one example of how physician group intelligence can be used to support evidence based medicine in a way that is automated and continually updated.}},

The primary vehicle used for this analysis is a comparison between the time-delayed mutual information averaged over the population and the time-delayed mutual information of an aggregated population (here, aggregation implies the population is conjoined before any statistical estimates are implemented). Through the use of information theoretic tools, a sequence of practically implementable calculations are detailed that allow for the average and aggregate time-delayed mutual information to be interpreted. Moreover, these calculations can also be used to understand the degree of homo or heterogeneity present in the population. To demonstrate that the proposed methods can be used in nearly any situation, the methods are applied and demonstrated on the time series of glucose measurements from two different subpopulations of individuals from the Columbia University Medical Center electronic health record repository, revealing a picture of the composition of the population as well as physiological features.}},

    abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The prediction of breast cancer survivability has been a challenging research problem for many researchers. Since the early dates of the related research, much advancement has been recorded in several related fields. For instance, thanks to innovative biomedical technologies, better explanatory prognostic factors are being measured and recorded; thanks to low cost computer hardware and software technologies, high volume better quality data is being collected and stored automatically; and finally thanks to better analytical methods, those voluminous data is being processed effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the main objective of this manuscript is to report on a research project where we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for breast cancer survivability. METHODS AND MATERIAL: We used two popular data mining algorithms (artificial neural networks and decision trees) along with a most commonly used statistical method (logistic regression) to develop the prediction models using a large dataset (more than 200,000 cases). We also used 10-fold cross-validation methods to measure the unbiased estimate of the three prediction models for performance comparison purposes. RESULTS: The results indicated that the decision tree (C5) is the best predictor with 93.6\% accuracy on the holdout sample (this prediction accuracy is better than any reported in the literature), artificial neural networks came out to be the second with 91.2\% accuracy and the logistic regression models came out to be the worst of the three with 89.2\% accuracy. CONCLUSION: The comparative study of multiple prediction models for breast cancer survivability using a large dataset along with a 10-fold cross-validation provided us with an insight into the relative prediction ability of different data mining methods. Using sensitivity analysis on neural network models provided us with the prioritized importance of the prognostic factors used in the study.}},

In the historical overview, I emphasize the naive Bayesian classifier, neural networks and decision trees. I present a comparison of some state-of-the-art systems, representatives from each branch of machine learning, when applied to several medical diagnostic tasks. The future trends are illustrated by two case studies. The first describes a recently developed method for dealing with reliability of decisions of classifiers, which seems to be promising for intelligent data analysis in medicine. The second describes an approach to using machine learning in order to verify some unexplained phenomena from complementary medicine, which is not (yet) approved by the orthodox medical community but could in the future play an important role in overall medical diagnosis and treatment.}},

A central issue in language model estimation is smoothing, the problem of adjusting the maximum likelihood estimator to compensate for data sparseness. In this article, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collections. Experimental results show that not only is the retrieval performance generally sensitive to the smoothing parameters, but also the sensitivity pattern is affected by the query type, with performance being more sensitive to smoothing for verbose queries than for keyword queries. Verbose queries also generally require more aggressive smoothing to achieve optimal performance. This suggests that smoothing plays two different role---to make the estimated document language model more accurate and to "explain" the noninformative words in the query. In order to decouple these two distinct roles of smoothing, we propose a two-stage smoothing strategy, which yields better sensitivity patterns and facilitates the setting of smoothing parameters automatically. We further propose methods for estimating the smoothing parameters automatically. Evaluation on five different databases and four types of queries indicates that the two-stage smoothing method with the proposed parameter estimation methods consistently gives retrieval performance that is close to---or better than---the best results achieved using a single smoothing method and exhaustive parameter search on the test data.}},

    abstract = {{To optimally leverage the scalability and unique features of the electronic health records (EHR) for research that would ultimately improve patient care, we need to accurately identify patients and extract clinically meaningful measures. Using multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proof of principle, we showcased how to leverage routinely collected EHR data to identify patients with a complex neurological disorder and derive an important surrogate measure of disease severity heretofore only available in research settings. In a cross-sectional observational study, 5,495 MS patients were identified from the EHR systems of two major referral hospitals using an algorithm that includes codified and narrative information extracted using natural language processing. In the subset of patients who receive neurological care at a MS Center where disease measures have been collected, we used routinely collected EHR data to extract two aggregate indicators of MS severity of clinical relevance multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF, a measure of whole brain volume). The EHR algorithm that identifies MS patients has an area under the curve of 0.958, 83\% sensitivity, 92\% positive predictive value, and 89\% negative predictive value when a 95\% specificity threshold is used. The correlation between EHR-derived and true MSSS has a mean R2 = 0.38±0.05, and that between EHR-derived and true BPF has a mean R2 = 0.22±0.08. To illustrate its clinical relevance, derived MSSS captures the expected difference in disease severity between relapsing-remitting and progressive MS patients after adjusting for sex, age of symptom onset and disease duration (p = 1.56×10−12). Incorporation of sophisticated codified and narrative EHR data accurately identifies MS patients and provides estimation of a well-accepted indicator of MS severity that is widely used in research settings but not part of the routine medical records. Similar approaches could be applied to other complex neurological disorders.}},

Using data from five different sets of EMRs, we have identified five disease phenotypes with positive predictive values of 73 to 98\% and negative predictive values of 98 to 100\%. Most EMRs captured key information (diagnoses, medications, laboratory tests) used to define phenotypes in a structured format.

    abstract = {{Studying physiology and pathophysiology over a broad population for long periods of time is difficult primarily because collecting human physiologic data can be intrusive, dangerous, and expensive. One solution is to use data that have been collected for a different purpose. Electronic health record (EHR) data promise to support the development and testing of mechanistic physiologic models on diverse populations and allow correlation with clinical outcomes, but limitations in the data have thus far thwarted such use. For example, using uncontrolled population-scale EHR data to verify the outcome of time dependent behavior of mechanistic, constructive models can be difficult because: (i) aggregation of the population can obscure or generate a signal, (ii) there is often no control population with a well understood health state, and (iii) diversity in how the population is measured can make the data difficult to fit into conventional analysis techniques. This paper shows that it is possible to use EHR data to test a physiological model for a population and over long time scales. Specifically, a methodology is developed and demonstrated for testing a mechanistic, time-dependent, physiological model of serum glucose dynamics with uncontrolled, population-scale, physiological patient data extracted from an EHR repository. It is shown that there is no observable daily variation the normalized mean glucose for any EHR subpopulations. In contrast, a derived value, daily variation in nonlinear correlation quantified by the time-delayed mutual information (TDMI), did reveal the intuitively expected diurnal variation in glucose levels amongst a random population of humans. Moreover, in a population of continuously (tube) fed patients, there was no observable TDMI-based diurnal signal. These TDMI-based signals, via a glucose insulin model, were then connected with human feeding patterns. In particular, a constructive physiological model was shown to correctly predict the difference between the general uncontrolled population and a subpopulation whose feeding was controlled.}},

    abstract = {{Answers to clinical and public health research questions increasingly require aggregated data from multiple sites. Data from electronic health records and other clinical sources are useful for such studies, but require stringent quality assessment. Data quality assessment is particularly important in multisite studies to distinguish true variations in care from data quality problems. We propose a "fit-for-use" conceptual model for data quality assessment and a process model for planning and conducting single-site and multisite data quality assessments. These approaches are illustrated using examples from prior multisite studies. Critical components of multisite data quality assessment include: thoughtful prioritization of variables and data quality dimensions for assessment; development and use of standardized approaches to data quality assessment that can improve data utility over time; iterative cycles of assessment within and between sites; targeting assessment toward data domains known to be vulnerable to quality problems; and detailed documentation of the rationale and outcomes of data quality assessments to inform data users. The assessment process requires constant communication between site-level data providers, data coordinating centers, and principal investigators. A conceptually based and systematically executed approach to data quality assessment is essential to achieve the potential of the electronic revolution in health care. High-quality data allow "learning health care organizations" to analyze and act on their own information, to compare their outcomes to peers, and to address critical scientific questions from the population perspective.}},

    abstract = {{To evaluate the validity of multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) data sharing for surveillance and study of childhood obesity. We conducted a non-concurrent cohort study of 528,340 children with outpatient visits to six pediatric academic medical centers during 2007–08, with sufficient data in the EHR for body mass index (BMI) assessment. EHR data were compared with data from the 2007–08 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Among children 2–17 years, BMI was evaluable for 1,398,655 visits (56\%). The EHR dataset contained over 6,000 BMI measurements per month of age up to 16 years, yielding precise estimates of BMI. In the EHR dataset, 18\% of children were obese versus 18\% in NHANES, while 35\% were obese or overweight versus 34\% in NHANES. BMI for an individual was highly reliable over time (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.90 for obese children and 0.97 for all children). Only 14\% of visits with measured obesity (BMI ≥95\%) had a diagnosis of obesity recorded, and only 20\% of children with measured obesity had the diagnosis documented during the study period. Obese children had higher primary care (4.8 versus 4.0 visits, p<0.001) and specialty care (3.7 versus 2.7 visits, p<0.001) utilization than non-obese counterparts, and higher prevalence of diverse co-morbidities. The cohort size in the EHR dataset permitted detection of associations with rare diagnoses. Data sharing did not require investment of extensive institutional resources, yet yielded high data quality. Multi-institutional EHR data sharing is a promising, feasible, and valid approach for population health surveillance. It provides a valuable complement to more resource-intensive national surveys, particularly for iterative surveillance and quality improvement. Low rates of obesity diagnosis present a significant obstacle to surveillance and quality improvement for care of children with obesity.}},

The main primary classified medical data are diagnoses and surgery codes. In Sweden, the number of secondary diagnoses per case increased during the 1990s. In the early 1990s some county councils introduced DRG systems. The present study investigated whether the introduction of such systems had influenced the number of secondary diagnoses. The nation-wide Hospital Discharge Register from 1988 to 2000 was used for the analyses. All regional hospitals were included, giving a database of 5,355,000 discharges. The hospitals were divided into those that had introduced prospective payment systems during the study period and those that had not. Among all regional hospitals, there was an increase in the number of coded secondary diagnoses, but also in the number of secondary diagnoses per case. Hospitals with prospective payment systems had a larger increase, starting after the system was introduced. Regional hospitals without prospect payment systems had a more constant increase, starting later and coinciding with the introduction of their DRG-based management systems. It is concluded that introduction of DRG-based systems, irrespective of use, focuses on recording diagnoses and therefore increases the number of diagnoses. Other reasons may also have contributed to the increase. It was found that the changes in the speciality mix, during the study period, have impact on the increase of secondary diagnoses.}},

Mining of electronic health records (EHRs) has the potential for establishing new patient-stratification principles and for revealing unknown disease correlations. Integrating EHR data with genetic data will also give a finer understanding of genotype–phenotype relationships. However, a broad range of ethical, legal and technical reasons currently hinder the systematic deposition of these data in EHRs and their mining. Here, we consider the potential for furthering medical research and clinical care using EHR data and the challenges that must be overcome before this is a reality.}},

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.}},

To date, many researchers have proposed various methods to build an intelligent portfolio management system that can recommend financial decisions for daily stock trading. Many promising results have been reported from the supervised learning community on the possibility of building a profitable trading system. More recently, several studies have shown that even the problem of integrating stock price prediction results with trading strategies can be successfully addressed by applying reinforcement learning algorithms. Motivated by this, we present a new stock trading framework that attempts to further enhance the performance of reinforcement learning-based systems. The proposed approach incorporates multiple Q-learning agents, allowing them to effectively divide and conquer the stock trading problem by defining necessary roles for cooperatively carrying out stock pricing and selection decisions. Furthermore, in an attempt to address the complexity issue when considering a large amount of data to obtain long-term dependence among the stock prices, we present a representation scheme that can succinctly summarize the history of price changes. Experimental results on a Korean stock market show that the proposed trading framework outperforms those trained by other alternative approaches both in terms of profit and risk management.}},

    abstract = {{We investigate the growth dynamics of Greater London defined by the administrative boundary of the Greater London Authority, based on the evolution of its street network during the last two centuries. This is done by employing a unique dataset, consisting of the planar graph representation of nine time slices of Greater London's road network spanning 224 years, from 1786 to 2010. Within this time-frame, we address the concept of the metropolitan area or city in physical terms, in that urban evolution reveals observable transitions in the distribution of relevant geometrical properties. Given that London has a hard boundary enforced by its long standing green belt, we show that its street network dynamics can be described as a fractal space-filling phenomena up to a capacitated limit, whence its growth can be predicted with a striking level of accuracy. This observation is confirmed by the analytical calculation of key topological properties of the planar graph, such as the topological growth of the network and its average connectivity. This study thus represents an example of a strong violation of Gibrat's law. In particular, we are able to show analytically how London evolves from a more loop-like structure, typical of planned cities, toward a more tree-like structure, typical of self-organized cities. These observations are relevant to the discourse on sustainable urban planning with respect to the control of urban sprawl in many large cities which have developed under the conditions of spatial constraints imposed by green belts and hard urban boundaries.}},

    abstract = {{Optimizing paths on networks is crucial for many applications, ranging from subway traffic to Internet communication. Because global path optimization that takes account of all path choices simultaneously is computationally hard, most existing routing algorithms optimize paths individually, thus providing suboptimal solutions. We use the physics of interacting polymers and disordered systems to analyze macroscopic properties of generic path optimization problems and derive a simple, principled, generic, and distributed routing algorithm capable of considering all individual path choices simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm by applying it to: (i) random graphs resembling Internet overlay networks, (ii) travel on the London Underground network based on Oyster card data, and (iii) the global airport network. Analytically derived macroscopic properties give rise to insightful new routing phenomena, including phase transitions and scaling laws, that facilitate better understanding of the appropriate operational regimes and their limitations, which are difficult to obtain otherwise.}},

    abstract = {{We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.}},

    abstract = {{With the widespread adoption of location tracking technologies like GPS, the domain of intelligent transportation services has seen growing interest in the last few years. Services in this domain make use of real-time location-based data from a variety of sources, combine this data with static location-based data such as maps and points of interest databases, and provide useful information to end-users. Some of the major challenges in this domain include i) scalability, in terms of processing large volumes of real-time and static data; ii) extensibility, in terms of being able to add new kinds of analyses on the data rapidly, and iii) user interaction, in terms of being able to support different kinds of one-time and continuous queries from the end-user. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of IBM InfoSphere Streams, a scalable stream processing platform, for tackling these challenges. We describe a prototype system that generates dynamic, multi-faceted views of transportation information for the city of Stockholm, using real vehicle GPS and road-network data. The system also continuously derives current traffic statistics, and provides useful value-added information such as shortest-time routes from real-time observed and inferred traffic conditions. Our performance experiments illustrate the scalability of the system. For instance, our system can process over 120000 incoming GPS points per second, combine it with a map containing over 600,000 links, continuously generate different kinds of traffic statistics and answer user queries.}},

The presented methodology may be incorporated in a variety of applications such as risk management, tailored health communication and decision support systems in healthcare.METHODS:We employed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data, which is publicly available through Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), to train random forest classifiers for disease prediction. Since the HCUP data is highly imbalanced, we employed an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random sub-sampling. This technique divides the training data into multiple sub-samples, while ensuring that each sub-sample is fully balanced. We compared the performance of support vector machine (SVM), bagging, boosting and RF to predict the risk of eight chronic diseases.RESULTS:We predicted eight disease categories. Overall, the RF ensemble learning method outperformed SVM, bagging and boosting in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). In addition, RF has the advantage of computing the importance of each variable in the classification process.CONCLUSIONS:In combining repeated random sub-sampling with RF, we were able to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieve promising results. Using the national HCUP data set, we predicted eight disease categories with an average AUC of 88.79\%.}},

The technique uses a Kohonen self-organizing map as an initial classifier; each class has an individually tuned ARIMA model associated with it. Using a Kohonen map which is hexagonal in layout eases the problem of defining the classes. The explicit separation of the tasks of classification and functional approximation greatly improves forecasting performance compared to either a single ARIMA model or a backpropagation neural network. The model is demonstrated by producing forecasts of traffic flow, at horizons of half an hour and an hour, for a French motorway. Performance is similar to that exhibited by other layered models, but the number of classes needed is much smaller (typically between two and four). Because the number of classes is small, it is concluded that the algorithm could be easily retrained in order to track long-term changes in traffic flow and should also prove to be readily transferrable.}},

The conducted study emphasized the potential benefit of optimizing the prediction performance by deploying multimodel approaches under parameters and traffic-condition settings. Emphasis was placed on the application of temporal-processing topologies in short-term speed predictions in the range of 5-min to 20-min horizons. Three network topologies were used: Jordan-Elman networks, partially recurrent networks, and time-lagged feedforward networks. The input patterns were constructed from data collected at the target location and at upstream and downstream locations. However, various combinations were also considered. To encourage the networks to associate with historical information on recurrent conditions, a time factor was attached to the input patterns to introduce time-recognition capabilities, in addition to information encoded in the recent past data. The optimal prediction settings (type of topology and input settings) were determined so that performance was maximized under different traffic conditions at the target and adjacent locations. The optimized performance of the dynamic neural networks was compared to that of a statistical nonlinear time series approach, which was outperformed in most cases. The study showed that no single topology consistently outperformed the others for all prediction horizons considered. However, the results showed that the significance of introducing the time factor was more pronounced under longer prediction horizons. A comparative evaluation of performance of optimal and nonoptimal settings showed substantial improvement in most cases. The applied procedure can also be used to identify the prediction reliability of information-dissemination systems.}},

This paper discusses how to improve travel time estimates by incorporating data from a small sample of probe vehicles, and proposes an Adaptive Kalman Filter (AKF) based method that can dynamically estimate noise statistics of the system model by adapting to the real-time data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated under both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion using a microscopic simulation model, PARAMICS. The evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves section travel time estimates compared to the cases when a single data source was used. Some sensitivity analyses show the robustness and applicability of the method by showing its capability working with the erratic point detector data at different freeway sections, and under different probe rates.}},

In this system, GPS-equipped taxicabs are employed as mobile sensors constantly probing the traffic rhythm of a city and taxi drivers' intelligence in choosing driving directions in the physical world. Meanwhile, a Cloud aggregates and mines the information from these taxis and other sources from the Internet, like Web maps and weather forecast. The Cloud builds a model incorporating day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, and individual driving strategies (both of the taxi drivers and of the end user for whom the route is being computed). Using this model, our system predicts the traffic conditions of a future time (when the computed route is actually driven) and performs a self-adaptive driving direction service for a particular user. This service gradually learns a user's driving behavior from the user's GPS logs and customizes the fastest route for the user with the help of the Cloud. We evaluate our service using a real-world dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of 3 months in Beijing. As a result, our service accurately estimates the travel time of a route for a user; hence finding the fastest route customized for the user.}},

The network model separates trip travel times into link travel times and intersection delays and allows correlation between travel times on different network links based on a spatial moving average (SMA) structure. The observation model presents a way to estimate the parameters of the network model, including the correlation structure, through low frequency sampling of vehicle traces. Link-specific effects are combined with link attributes (speed limit, functional class, etc.) and trip conditions (day of week, season, weather, etc.) as explanatory variables. The approach captures the underlying factors behind spatial and temporal variations in speeds, which is useful for traffic management, planning and forecasting. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood. The model is applied in a case study for the network of Stockholm, Sweden. Link attributes and trip conditions (including recent snowfall) have significant effects on travel times and there is significant positive correlation between segments.

    abstract = {{Estimating and predicting traffic conditions in arterial networks using probe data has proven to be a substantial challenge. Sparse probe data represent the vast majority of the data available on arterial roads. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling framework for estimating and predicting arterial travel-time distributions using sparsely observed probe vehicles. We introduce a model based on hydrodynamic traffic theory to learn the density of vehicles on arterial road segments, illustrating the distribution of delay within a road segment. The characterization of this distribution is essentially to use probe vehicles for traffic estimation: Probe vehicles report their location at random locations, and the travel times between location reports must be properly scaled to match the map discretization. A dynamic Bayesian network represents the spatiotemporal dependence on the network and provides a flexible framework to learn traffic dynamics from historical data and to perform real-time estimation with streaming data. The model is evaluated using data from a fleet of 500 probe vehicles in San Francisco, CA, which send Global Positioning System (GPS) data to our server every minute. The numerical experiments analyze the learning and estimation capabilities on a subnetwork with more than 800 links. The sampling rate of the probe vehicles does not provide detailed information about the location where vehicles encountered delay or the reason for any delay (i.e., signal delay, congestion delay, etc.). The model provides an increase in estimation accuracy of 35\% when compared with a baseline approach to process probe-vehicle data.}},

Our work points towards a more decentralized approach that may overcome those risks. We use new category of the ITS infrastructure called the probe-car system.

The effectiveness and strength of our algorithms are validated by experiments on a very large volume of real taxi trajectories in an urban road network.}},

    abstract = {{We provide a procedure to fit a FARIMA(p,d,q) (fractional autoregressive integrated moving average) model to the actual traffic trace, as well as a method to generate a FARIMA process with given parameters. We show how to model the traffic by fitting FARIMA models to four measured traces. Our experiments illustrate that the FARIMA model is a good traffic model and is capable of capturing the property of real traffic with long-range and short-range dependent behavior. Unlike previous work on FARIMA models, we deduce some guidelines to reduce the complexity of fitting the FARIMA model which would allow us to reduce the computational time of fitting.}},

    abstract = {{Predicting traffic requirements is a fundamental objective of network management algorithms, whether explicitly stated or not. Considering the abundant evidence that traffic is long-range dependent (LRD) and the fact that the history of long-range dependent processes has significant impact on the present value of the process, it is natural to assume that predicting LRD traffic would be rather rewarding. Although there is indeed significant performance gain in using the correlation structure as the Hurst parameter increases, we show in this paper that this is primarily due to the utilization of the specific short-term correlations that occur within the structure of the traffic, rather than storing a long history of the traffic and utilizing the long-term correlations that exist between the future traffic level and this stored history. This conclusion is demonstrated using two specific management functions: rate control for elastic connections, and queue management using probabilistic packet discarding}},

    abstract = {{The use of the world wide web for clinical trials changes the processes of performing clinical research in several fundamental ways. Greatly improved security, monitoring capability, and accuracy and timeliness of study conduct can be achieved while lowering cost. Data quality is enhanced while co-ordinating centre effort is reduced. The web provides a natural environment for linking the various components of clinical research, leading to new levels of simplicity and efficiency. It also enhances opportunities for recruitment of study investigators and patients. Other information technology tools and databases can be used to assist in this regard as well. Web-based trials change the relationship of the investigator site to the study and the site to the co-ordinating centre. Different roles and responsibilities lead to simplified processes and more and higher quality data. Many standard co-ordinating centre activities, such as randomization, protocol implementation and amending, document tracking, adverse event reporting, site monitoring, report generation and data analysis are all fundamentally changed in a web-based trial. Opportunities are enhanced to identify potential investigators and support their successful study conduct. As the role of investigator sites is changed in web-based research, more primary care medical providers can be attracted to research, providing more typical patients to studies than those sometimes available through more traditional research sites, especially those at academic study sites. Other activities can now be co-ordinated electronically with the advent of the web. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) can use online tools to control investigator participation, resulting in improved study efficiency and patient safety. A web-based research pharmacy provides tremendous efficiencies in managing and distributing study medications. Financial payments to the sites can be performed and recorded electronically, or even administered based on timeliness and quality of the data. Our early experience with web-based trials indicates that there can be tremendous gains in study efficiency and accuracy by restructuring processes, roles and responsibilities through a comprehensive centralized, web-based trial. The future appears bright for web-based clinical trials. Copyright {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

This paper, developed by the National Alliance for Primary Care Informatics, a collaborative group sponsored by a number of primary care societies, argues that providers' and patients' information and decision support needs can be satisfied only if primary care providers use electronic medical records (EMRs). Although robust EMRs are now available, only about 5\% of U.S. primary care providers use them. Recently, with only modest investments, Australia, New Zealand, and England have achieved major breakthroughs in implementing EMRs in primary care. Substantial benefits realizable through routine use of electronic medical records include improved quality, safety, and efficiency, along with increased ability to conduct education and research. Nevertheless, barriers to adoption exist and must be overcome. Implementing specific policies can accelerate utilization of EMRs in the U.S.}},

    abstract = {{Identifying social influence in networks is critical to understanding how behaviors spread. We present a method that uses in vivo randomized experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social contagion. Estimation in a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook users showed that younger users are more susceptible to influence than older users, men are more influential than women, women influence men more than they influence other women, and married individuals are the least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product offered. Analysis of influence and susceptibility together with network structure revealed that influential individuals are less susceptible to influence than noninfluential individuals and that they cluster in the network while susceptible individuals do not, which suggests that influential people with influential friends may be instrumental in the spread of this product in the network.}},

Here we ask how trade-offs affect the range of phenotypes found in nature. Using the Pareto front concept from economics and engineering, we find that best–trade-off phenotypes are weighted averages of archetypes—phenotypes specialized for single tasks. For two tasks, phenotypes fall on the line connecting the two archetypes, which could explain linear trait correlations, allometric relationships, as well as bacterial gene-expression patterns. For three tasks, phenotypes fall within a triangle in phenotype space, whose vertices are the archetypes, as evident in morphological studies, including on Darwin's finches. Tasks can be inferred from measured phenotypes based on the behavior of organisms nearest the archetypes.}},

There has been rapid deployment of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies in most urban areas of North America in the last 10 years. While ITSs are developed primarily for real-time traffic operations, the data are typically archived and available for traffic microsimulation calibration. A methodology, based on the sequential simplex algorithm, that uses ITS data to calibrate microsimulation models is presented. The test bed is a 23-km section of Interstate 10 in Houston, Texas. Two microsimulation models, CORSIM and TRANSIMS, were calibrated for two different demand matrices and three periods (morning peak, evening peak, and off-peak). It was found for the morning peak that the simplex algorithm had better results then either the default values or a simple, manual calibration. As the level of congestion decreased, the effectiveness of the simplex approach also decreased, as compared with standard techniques.}},

    abstract = {{Prediction of daily maximum surface ozone (O<SUB>3</SUB>) concentration
was begun by Environment Canada in the spring of 1993 for the Vancouver,
Montreal, and Atlantic regions in order to advise the public of expected
air quality. Forecasts have been issued for southern Ontario for many
years by the province of Ontario, but this is a new undertaking in other
parts of the country, where air quality has become a concern in recent
years. There is a need for guidance to prepare the forecasts,
particularly for prediction of surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration
levels near or exceeding the Canadian 1-h maximum acceptable
concentration of 82 ppb. Such occurrences are episodic and relatively
rare in southern Canada. Probability of occurrence is in the range 0.00
0.08 at the sites in the regions studied here, thus, reliable prediction
is difficult without guidance. Mesoscale numerical meteorological
photochemical models are not currently available for routine use in
operations, but the capability exists for development and use of
sophisticated multivariate statistical techniques for prediction of
daily maximum O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration. Most statistical ozone
forecast procedures to date in Canada have been based on multiple linear
regression with a limited number of predictors mainly drawn from surface
meteorology and subjective classification of the synoptic meteorological
flow pattern. Since the relationship between surface O<SUB>3</SUB> and
meteorology is nonlinear, tree-based statistical models with several
predictors are appropriate for developing objective forecast
guidance.Surface and upper-air meteorological predictors and other
predictors were matched with several years of observed daily maximum
O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations for the months of May September at
air-monitoring sites in the three regions. A recent nonparametric
data-driven tree-based analysis method known as CART (classification and
regression trees) was used to analyze the data at each site. The
decision trees built by CART were found to fit the data reasonably well,
and the rules for node splitting were found to be physically realistic.
Some of the important aspects of the analyses are noted. One interesting
result was that moisture content of the air plays a limiting role on the
maximum surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentration that can be achieved when
other factors point to occurrence of high values.The decision trees can
be used to predict maximum surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations if the
predictor variables are forecast, thus providing an inexpensive
site-specific model for forecasts and climate impact analysis. An
estimation of performance with independent data was conducted for the
Vancouver lower Fraser River valley and Montreal regions for each of the
five years 1988 92. Verification of the ensemble of forecasts in the two
regions shows the technique would have reasonably good skill in
forecasting surface O<SUB>3</SUB> concentrations near or exceeding
acceptable 1-h limits. A computer version of the technique has been
provided for use in the regional forecast offices.}},

    abstract = {{Novel statistical approaches to prediction have recently been shown to perform well in several scientific fields but have not, until now, been comprehensively evaluated for predicting air pollution. In this paper we report on a model inter-comparison exercise in which 15 different statistical techniques for ozone forecasting were applied to ten data sets representing different meteorological and emission conditions throughout Europe. We also attempt to compare the performance of the statistical techniques with a deterministic chemical trajectory model. Likewise, our exercise includes comparisons of sites, performance indices, forecasting horizons, etc. The comparative evaluation of forecasting performance (benchmarking) produced 1340 yearly time series of daily predictions and the results are described in terms of predefined performance indices. Through analysing associations between the performance indices, we found that the success index is of outstanding significance. For models that are excellent in predicting threshold exceedances and have a high success index, we also observe high performance in the overall goodness of fit. The 8-h average ozone concentration forecast accuracy was found to be superior to the 1-h mean ozone concentration forecast, which makes the former very significant for operational forecasting. The best forecasts were achieved for sites located in rural and suburban areas in Central Europe unaffected by extreme emissions (e.g. from industries). Our results demonstrate that a particular technique is often excellent in some respects but poor in others. For most situations, we recommend neural network and generalised additive models as the best compromise, as these can handle nonlinear associations and can be easily adapted to site specific conditions. In contrast, nonlinear modelling of the dynamical development of univariate ozone time-series was not profitable.}},

    abstract = {{A variety of statistical methods for meteorological adjustment of ozone have been proposed in the literature over the last decade for purposes of forecasting, estimating ozone time trends, or investigating underlying mechanisms from an empirical perspective. The methods can be broadly classified into regression, extreme value, and space–time methods. We present a critical review of these methods, beginning with a summary of what meteorological and ozone monitoring data have been considered and how they have been used for statistical analysis. We give particular attention to the question of trend estimation, and compare selected methods in an application to ozone time series from the Chicago area. We conclude that a number of approaches make useful contributions to the field, but that no one method is most appropriate for all purposes and all meteorological scenarios. Methodological issues such as the need for regional-scale analysis, the nonlinear dependence of ozone on meteorology, and extreme value analysis for trends are addressed. A comprehensive and reliable methodology for space–time extreme value analysis is attractive but lacking.}},

@article{citeulike:2772493,
    abstract = {{Much work on skewed, stochastic, high dimensional, and biased datasets usually implicitly solve each problem separately. Recently, we have been approached by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to help them build highly accurate ozone level alarm forecasting models for the Houston area, where these technical difficulties come together in one single problem. Key characteristics of this problem that is challenging and interesting include: (1) the dataset is sparse (72 features, and 2 or 5\% positives depending on the criteria of  ” ozone days”), (2) evolving over time from year to year, (3) limited in collected data size (7  years or around 2,500 data entries), (4) contains a large number of irrelevant features, (5) is biased in terms of  ” sample selection bias”, and (6) the true model is stochastic as a function of measurable factors. Besides solving a difficult application problem, this dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore new and existing data mining techniques, and to provide experience, guidance and solution for similar problems. Our main technical focus addresses on how to estimate reliable probability given both sample selection bias and a large number of irrelevant features, and how to choose the most reliable decision threshold to predict the unknown future with different distribution. On the application side, the prediction accuracy of our chosen approach (bagging probabilistic decision trees and random decision trees) is 20\% higher in recall (correctly detects 1–3 more ozone days, depending on the year) and 10\% higher in precision (15–30 fewer false alarm days per year) than state-of-the-art methods used by air quality control scientists, and these results are significant for TCEQ. On the technical side of data mining, extensive empirical results demonstrate that, at least for this problem, and probably other problems with similar characteristics, these two straight-forward non-parametric methods can provide significantly more accurate and reliable solutions than a number of sophisticated and well-known algorithms, such as SVM and AdaBoost among many others.}},

    abstract = {{Although it is intuitively obvious that neighborhood quality and accessibility should affect housing prices, the empirical evidence is weak: Most hedonic estimations show few significant coefficients on the neighborhood and accessibility variables. The lack of empirical support for the capitalization of neighborhood and accessibility effects may stem from the multicentric nature of the city as well as measurement problems with regard to neighborhood quality. In this paper, an alternative approach is taken: Omit all neighborhood and accessibility measures from the set of explanatory variables and instead model the resulting autocorrelation in the error term. Data from Baltimore are used in an empirical example; the results show that this approach provides a very plausible pattern of housing price variation.}},

                Complete repertoires of molecular activity in and between tissues provided by new high-dimensional "omics" technologies hold great promise for characterizing human physiology at all levels of biological hierarchies. The combined effects of genetic and environmental perturbations at any level of these hierarchies can lead to vicious cycles of pathology and complex systemic diseases. The challenge lies in extracting all relevant information from the rapidly increasing volumes of omics data and translating this information first into knowledge and ultimately into wisdom that can yield clinically actionable results. Here, we discuss how molecular networks are central to the implementation of this new biology in medicine and translation to preventive and personalized health care.

The crucial step is how to best select the next cluster(s) to split or merge. We provide a comprehensive analysis of selection methods and propose several new methods. We perform extensive clustering experiments to test 8 selection methods, and find that the average similarity is the best method in divisive clustering and the minmax linkage is the best in agglomerative clustering. Cluster balance is a key factor to achieve good performance.

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Mean-based clustering algorithms such as bisecting k-means generally lack robustness. Although componentwise median is a more robust alternative, it can be a poor center representative for high dimensional data. We need a new algorithm that is robust and works well in high dimensional data sets e.g. gene expression data.RESULTS:Here we propose a new robust divisive clustering algorithm, the bisecting k-spatialMedian, based on the statistical spatial depth. A new subcluster selection rule, Relative Average Depth, is also introduced. We demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm outperforms the componentwise-median-based bisecting k-median algorithm for high dimension and low sample size (HDLSS) data via applications of the algorithms on two real HDLSS gene expression data sets. When further applied on noisy real data sets, the proposed algorithm compares favorably in terms of robustness with the componentwise-median-based bisecting k-median algorithm.CONCLUSION:Statistical data depths provide an alternative way to find the "center" of multivariate data sets and are useful and robust for clustering.}},

                Searching for the longest common sequence (LCS) of multiple biosequences is one of the most fundamental tasks in bioinformatics. In this paper, we present a parallel algorithm named FAST\_LCS to speedup the computation for finding LCS.
                A fast parallel algorithm for LCS is presented. The algorithm first constructs a novel successor table to obtain all the identical pairs and their levels. It then obtains the LCS by tracing back from the identical character pairs at the last level. Effective pruning techniques are developed to significantly reduce the computational complexity. Experimental results on gene sequences in the tigr database show that our algorithm is optimal and much more efficient than other leading LCS algorithms.
                We have developed one of the fastest parallel LCS algorithms on an MPP parallel computing model. For two sequences X and Y with lengths n and m, respectively, the memory required is max{4*(n+1)+4*(m+1), L}, where L is the number of identical character pairs. The time complexity is O(L) for sequential execution, and O(|LCS(X, Y)|) for parallel execution, where |LCS(X, Y)| is the length of the LCS of X and Y. For n sequences X1, X2, ..., Xn, the time complexity is O(L) for sequential execution, and O(|LCS(X1, X2, ..., Xn)|) for parallel execution. Experimental results support our analysis by showing significant improvement of the proposed method over other leading LCS algorithms.

The key idea of the proposed methodology is that when spillovers from a downstream link block vehicle departures from the upstream signal line, queues discharge at rates smaller than the saturation flow. The application of the methodology on an arterial site and the comparison with field data show that it consistently identifies spillovers in urban networks with signal-controlled intersections. The method is extended to account for the variations in vehicle lengths. We also investigate the significant effect of spillovers in congestion and show that a macroscopic diagram that connects spillovers with vehicle density exists in large-scale congested urban networks.}},

    abstract = {{The vast majority of data mining algorithms require the setting of many input parameters. The dangers of working with parameter-laden algorithms are twofold. First, incorrect settings may cause an algorithm to fail in finding the true patterns. Second, a perhaps more insidious problem is that the algorithm may report spurious patterns that do not really exist, or greatly overestimate the significance of the reported patterns. This is especially likely when the user fails to understand the role of parameters in the data mining process. Data mining algorithms should have as few parameters as possible. A parameter-light algorithm would limit our ability to impose our prejudices, expectations, and presumptions on the problem at hand, and would let the data itself speak to us. In this work, we show that recent results in bioinformatics, learning, and computational theory hold great promise for a parameter-light data-mining paradigm. The results are strongly connected to Kolmogorov complexity theory. However, as a practical matter, they can be implemented using any off-the-shelf compression algorithm with the addition of just a dozen lines of code. We will show that this approach is competitive or superior to many of the state-of-the-art approaches in anomaly/interestingness detection, classification, and clustering with empirical tests on time series/DNA/text/XML/video datasets. As a further evidence of the advantages of our method, we will demonstrate its effectiveness to solve a real world classification problem in recommending printing services and products.}},

    abstract = {{The use of compression algorithms in machine learning tasks such as clustering and classification has appeared in a variety of fields, sometimes with the promise of reducing problems of explicit feature selection. The theoretical justification for such methods has been founded on an upper bound on Kolmogorov complexity and an idealized information space. An alternate view shows compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. Thus, compression-based methods are not a "parameter free" magic bullet for feature selection and data representation, but are instead concrete similarity measures within defined feature spaces, and are therefore akin to explicit feature vector models used in standard machine learning algorithms. To underscore this point, we find theoretical and empirical connections between traditional machine learning vector models and compression, encouraging cross-fertilization in future work}},

    abstract = {{Sequence classification has a broad range of applications such as genomic analysis, information retrieval, health informatics, finance, and abnormal detection. Different from the classification task on feature vectors, sequences do not have explicit features. Even with sophisticated feature selection techniques, the dimensionality of potential features may still be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to capture. This makes sequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In this paper, we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. We summarize the sequence classification in terms of methodologies and application domains. We also provide a review on several extensions of the sequence classification problem, such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.}},

    abstract = {{Recently, there is an increasing interest in new intelligent mining methods to find more meaningful and compact results. In intelligent data mining research, accessing the quality and usefulness of the results from different mining methods is essential. However, there is no general benchmarking criteria to evaluate whether these new methods are indeed more effective compared to the traditional methods. Here we propose a novel benchmarking criteria that can systematically evaluate the effectiveness of any sequential pattern mining method under a variety of situations. The benchmark evaluates how well a mining method finds known common patterns in synthetic data. Such an evaluation provides a comprehensive understanding of the resulting patterns generated from any mining method empirically. In this paper, the criteria are applied to conduct a detailed comparison study of the support-based sequential pattern model with an approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. The study suggests that the alignment model will give a good summary of the sequential data in the form of a set of common patterns in the data. In contrast, the support model generates massive amounts of frequent patterns with much redundancy. This suggests that the results of the support model require more post processing before it can be of actual use in real applications.}},

    abstract = {{Urban transportation system is a large complex nonlinear system. It consists of surface-way networks, freeway networks, and ramps with a mixed traffic flow of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Traffic congestions occur frequently, which affect daily life and pose all kinds of problems and challenges. Alleviation of traffic congestions not only improves travel safety and efficiencies but also reduces environmental pollution. Among all the solutions, traffic signal control (TSC) is commonly thought as the most important and effective method. TSC algorithms have evolved quickly, especially over the past several decades. As a result, several TSC systems have been widely implemented in the world, making TSC a major component of intelligent transportation system (ITS). In TSC and ITS, many new technologies can be adopted. Computational intelligence (CI), which mainly includes artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and evolutionary computation algorithms, brings flexibility, autonomy, and robustness to overcome nonlinearity and randomness of traffic systems. This paper surveys some commonly used CI paradigms, analyzes their applications in TSC systems for urban surface-way and freeway networks, and introduces current and potential issues of control and management of recurrent and nonrecurrent congestions in traffic networks, in order to provide valuable references for further research and development.}},

We developed a novel method to identify and prioritize disease genes, which was generally applicable to complex diseases.RESULTS:We identified modules of highly interconnected genes in disease-specific networks derived from integrating gene-expression and protein interaction data. We examined if those modules were enriched for disease-associated SNPs, and could be used to find novel genes for functional studies. First, we analyzed publicly available gene expression microarray and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 13, highly diverse, complex diseases. In each disease, highly interconnected genes formed modules, which were significantly enriched for genes harboring disease-associated SNPs. To test if such modules could be used to find novel genes for functional studies, we repeated the analyses using our own gene expression microarray and GWAS data from seasonal allergic rhinitis. We identified a novel gene, FGF2, whose relevance was supported by functional studies using combined small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and gene expression microarrays. The modules in the 13 complex diseases analyzed here tended to overlap and were enriched for pathways related to oncological, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. This suggested that this union of the modules would be associated with a general increase in susceptibility for complex diseases. Indeed, we found that this union was enriched with GWAS genes for 145 other complex diseases.CONCLUSIONS:Modules of highly interconnected complex disease genes were enriched for disease-associated SNPs, and could be used to find novel genes for functional studies.}},

    abstract = {{A goal of systems biology is to analyze large-scale molecular networks including gene expressions and protein-protein interactions, revealing the relationships between network structures and their biological functions. Dividing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network into naturally grouped parts is an essential way to investigate the relationship between topology of networks and their functions. However, clear modular decomposition is often hard due to the heterogeneous or scale-free properties of PPI networks. To address this problem, we propose a diffusion model-based spectral clustering algorithm, which analytically solves the cluster structure of PPI networks as a problem of random walks in the diffusion process in them. To cope with the heterogeneity of the networks, the power factor is introduced to adjust the diffusion matrix by weighting the transition (adjacency) matrix according to a node degree matrix. This algorithm is named adjustable diffusion matrix-based spectral clustering (ADMSC). To demonstrate the feasibility of ADMSC, we apply it to decomposition of a yeast PPI network, identifying biologically significant clusters with approximately equal size. Compared with other established algorithms, ADMSC facilitates clear and fast decomposition of PPI networks. ADMSC is proposed by introducing the power factor that adjusts the diffusion matrix to the heterogeneity of the PPI networks. ADMSC effectively partitions PPI networks into biologically significant clusters with almost equal sizes, while being very fast, robust and appealing simple.}},

The Nystr\"{o}m method is a popular technique to generate low-rank matrix approximations but it requires sampling of a large number of columns from the original matrix to achieve good accuracy. This chapter describes a new family of algorithms based on mixtures of Nystr\"{o}m approximations, Ensemble Nystr\"{o}m algorithms , that yield more accurate low-rank approximations than the standard Nystr\"{o}m method. We give a detailed study of variants of these algorithms based on simple averaging, an exponential weight method, and regression-based methods. A theoretical analysis of these algorithms, including novel error bounds guaranteeing a better convergence rate than the standard Nystr\"{o}m method is also presented. Finally, experiments with several datasets containing up to 1 M points are presented, demonstrating significant improvement over the standard Nystr\"{o}m approximation.}},

This paper presents detailed studies on the Nystr\"{o}m sampling scheme and in particular, an error analysis that directly relates the Nystr\"{o}m approximation quality with the encoding powers of the landmark points in summarizing the data. The resultant error bound suggests a simple and efficient sampling scheme, the k-means clustering algorithm, for Nystr\"{o}m low-rank approximation.

    abstract = {{Spectral clustering algorithms have been shown to be more effective in finding clusters than some traditional algorithms, such as k-means. However, spectral clustering suffers from a scalability problem in both memory use and computational time when the size of a data set is large. To perform clustering on large data sets, we investigate two representative ways of approximating the dense similarity matrix. We compare one approach by sparsifying the matrix with another by the Nyström method. We then pick the strategy of sparsifying the matrix via retaining nearest neighbors and investigate its parallelization. We parallelize both memory use and computation on distributed computers. Through an empirical study on a document data set of 193,844 instances and a photo data set of 2,121,863, we show that our parallel algorithm can effectively handle large problems.}},

    abstract = {{Most mathematical models for the spread of disease use differential equations based on uniform mixing assumptions1 or ad hoc models for the contact process2, 3, 4. Here we explore the use of dynamic bipartite graphs to model the physical contact patterns that result from movements of individuals between specific locations. The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like5 graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free6, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.}},

We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation.

emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has
excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function
calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it
requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \$\sim N^2\$ for a
traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we
describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API.
Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to

    abstract = {{The equal headway instability phenomenon is pervasive in public transport systems. This instability is characterized by an aggregation of vehicles that causes inefficient service. While equal headway instability is common, it has not been studied independently of a particular scenario. However, the phenomenon is apparent in many transport systems and can be modeled and rectified in abstraction. We present a multi-agent simulation where a default method with no restrictions always leads to unstable headways. We discuss two methods that attempt to achieve equal headways, called minimum and maximum. Since one parameter of the methods depends on the passenger density, adaptive versions—where the relevant parameter is adjusted automatically—are also put forward. Our results show that the adaptive maximum method improves significantly over the default method. The model and simulation give insights of the interplay between transport design and passenger behavior. Finally, we provide technological and social suggestions for engineers and passengers to help achieve equal headways and thus reduce delays. The equal headway instability phenomenon can be avoided with the suggested technological and social measures.}},

This is possible because of a  ” slower-is-faster” effect, where passengers wait more time at stations but total travel times are reduced.

    abstract = {{This paper assesses the predictability of network traffic by
considering two metrics: (1) how far into the future a traffic rate
process can be predicted for a given error constraint; (2) what the
minimum prediction error is over a specified prediction time interval.
The assessment is based on two stationary traffic models: the
auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) model and the Markov-modulated
Poisson process (MMPP) model. Our study in this paper provides an upper
bound for the optimal performance of online traffic prediction. The
analysis reveals that the application of traffic prediction is limited
by the quickly deteriorating prediction accuracy with increasing
prediction interval. Furthermore, we show that different traffic
properties play different roles in predictability. Traffic smoothing
(low-pass filtering) and statistical multiplexing also improves
predictability. In particular, experimental results suggest that traffic
prediction works better for backbone network traffic, or when short-term
traffic variations have been properly filtered out. Moreover, this paper
illustrates the various factors affecting the effectiveness of traffic
prediction in network control. These factors include the traffic
characteristics, the traffic measurement intervals, the network control
time-scale, and the utilization target of network resources. Considering
all of the factors, we present guidelines for utilizing and evaluating
traffic prediction in network control areas}},

To date, these interaction maps have typically been generated under a single condition, even though biological systems undergo differential change that is dependent on environment, tissue type, disease state, development or speciation. Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.}},

We use a novel approach to study structure-dynamics correlations where the nodes of directed complex networks were partitioned into border and non-border by using the so-called diversity measurement. The network topology is characterized by the node degree, the most direct indicator of node connectivity, while the dynamics is related to the steady-state random walker occupation probability (called here node activity ). Correlations between degree and activity were then analyzed inside and outside the border, separately. The obtained results showed that the intricate correlations found in the macaque cortex and in a WWW subgraph are in fact composed of two separate correlations of in-degree against the activity occurring inside and outside the border. These findings pave the way to investigations of possibly similar behavior in other directed complex networks.}},

The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.}},

    abstract = {{Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of  ” missing heritability” of common traits. Although studies have discovered >1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the numerator—that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from overestimation of the denominator, creating  ” phantom heritability.” Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified, because models with interactions are also consistent with observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of heritability explained much larger. For example, 80\% of the currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not directly correspond to missing variants, because current estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not inflated by genetic interactions.}},

    abstract = {{Most diseases are the consequence of the breakdown of cellular processes, but the relationships among genetic/epigenetic defects, the molecular interaction networks underlying them, and the disease phenotypes remain poorly understood. To gain insights into such relationships, here we constructed a bipartite human disease association network in which nodes are diseases and two diseases are linked if mutated enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic reactions. We find that connected disease pairs display higher correlated reaction flux rate, corresponding enzyme-encoding gene coexpression, and higher comorbidity than those that have no metabolic link between them. Furthermore, the more connected a disease is to other diseases, the higher is its prevalence and associated mortality rate. The network topology-based approach also helps to uncover potential mechanisms that contribute to their shared pathophysiology. Thus, the structure and modeled function of the human metabolic network can provide insights into disease comorbidity, with potentially important consequences for disease diagnosis and prevention.}},

    abstract = {{A network of disorders and disease genes linked by known disorder-gene associations offers a platform to explore in a single graph-theoretic framework all known phenotype and disease gene associations, indicating the common genetic origin of many diseases. Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in the human interactome. In contrast, we find that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indicates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.}},

                Contemporary views of human disease are based on simple correlation between clinical syndromes and pathological analysis dating from the late 19th century. Although this approach to disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment has served the medical establishment and society well for many years, it has serious shortcomings for the modern era of the genomic medicine that stem from its reliance on reductionist principles of experimentation and analysis. Quantitative, holistic systems biology applied to human disease offers a unique approach for diagnosing established disease, defining disease predilection, and developing individualized (personalized) treatment strategies that can take full advantage of modern molecular pathobiology and the comprehensive data sets that are rapidly becoming available for populations and individuals. In this way, systems pathobiology offers the promise of redefining our approach to disease and the field of medicine.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We applied this approach to segmenting static images, as well as motion sequences, and found the results to be very encouraging}},

                Confidence is an essential ingredient of success in a wide range of domains ranging from job performance and mental health to sports, business and combat. Some authors have suggested that not just confidence but overconfidence--believing you are better than you are in reality--is advantageous because it serves to increase ambition, morale, resolve, persistence or the credibility of bluffing, generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in which exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success. However, overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations and hazardous decisions, so it remains a puzzle how such a false belief could evolve or remain stable in a population of competing strategies that include accurate, unbiased beliefs. Here we present an evolutionary model showing that, counterintuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and populations tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from contested resources are sufficiently large compared with the cost of competition. In contrast, unbiased strategies are only stable under limited conditions. The fact that overconfident populations are evolutionarily stable in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial collapses, policy failures, disasters and costly wars.

@article{citeulike:9134773,
    abstract = {{Why does Zipf's law give a good description of data from seemingly completely unrelated phenomena? Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be described as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the elements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country and so on. A random group formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate is obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for the number of groups with  k  elements, given the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification of these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution  N ( k )∝exp(− bk )/ k γ , where the power-law index γ is a unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is made possible by the fact that no system-specific assumptions are made about the mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between γ and the total number of elements, groups and the number of elements in the largest group is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is shown that γ usually takes values in the interval 1≤γ≤2 and that the value for a given phenomenon depends in a systematic way on the total size of the dataset. The results are put in the context of earlier discussions on Zipf's and Gibrat's laws,  N ( k )∝ k −2  and the connection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.}},

    abstract = {{Zipf's law and Heaps' law are two representatives of the scaling concepts, which play a significant role in the study of complexity science. The coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law motivates different understandings on the dependence between these two scalings, which has still hardly been clarified. In this article, we observe an evolution process of the scalings: the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law are naturally shaped to coexist at the initial time, while the crossover comes with the emergence of their inconsistency at the larger time before reaching a stable state, where the Heaps' law still exists with the disappearance of strict Zipf's law. Such findings are illustrated with a scenario of large-scale spatial epidemic spreading, and the empirical results of pandemic disease support a universal analysis of the relation between the two laws regardless of the biological details of disease. Employing the United States domestic air transportation and demographic data to construct a metapopulation model for simulating the pandemic spread at the U.S. country level, we uncover that the broad heterogeneity of the infrastructure plays a key role in the evolution of scaling emergence. The analyses of large-scale spatial epidemic spreading help understand the temporal evolution of scalings, indicating the coexistence of the Zipf's law and the Heaps' law depends on the collective dynamics of epidemic processes, and the heterogeneity of epidemic spread indicates the significance of performing targeted containment strategies at the early time of a pandemic disease.}},

The data set comprises all 30 sequences of length above 50 000 base pairs in GenBank Release No. 81.0, as well as the recently published sequences of C.elegans chromosome III (2.2 Mbp) and yeast chromosome XI (661 Kbp). We find that for the three chromosomes we studied the statistical properties of noncoding regions appear to be closer to those observed in natural languages than those of the coding regions. In particular, (i) an n-tuple Zipf analysis of noncoding regions reveals a regime close to power-law behavior while the coding regions show logarithmic behavior over a wide interval, while (ii) an n-gram entropy measurement shows that the noncoding regions have a lower n-gram entropy (and hence a larger ''n-gram redundancy'') than the coding regions. In contrast to the three chromosomes, we find that for vertebrates—such as primates and rodents—and for viral DNA, the difference between the statistical properties of coding and noncoding regions is not pronounced and therefore the results of the analyses of the investigated sequences are less conclusive. After noting the intrinsic limitations of the n-gram redundancy analysis, we also briefly discuss the failure of zero- and first-order Markovian models or simple nucleotide repeats to account fully for these ''linguistic'' features of DNA. Finally, we emphasize that our results by no means prove the existence of a ''language'' in noncoding DNA.}},

    abstract = {{An unusual pattern in a nucleic acid or protein sequence or a region of strong similarity shared by two or more sequences may have biological significance. It is therefore desirable to know whether such a pattern can have arisen simply by chance. To identify interesting sequence patterns, appropriate scoring values can be assigned to the individual residues of a single sequence or to sets of residues when several sequences are compared. For single sequences, such scores can reflect biophysical properties such as charge, volume, hydrophobicity, or secondary structure potential; for multiple sequences, they can reflect nucleotide or amino acid similarity measured in a wide variety of ways. Using an appropriate random model, we present a theory that provides precise numerical formulas for assessing the statistical significance of any region with high aggregate score. A second class of results describes the composition of high-scoring segments. In certain contexts, these permit the choice of scoring systems which are "optimal" for distinguishing biologically relevant patterns. Examples are given of applications of the theory to a variety of protein sequences, highlighting segments with unusual biological features. These include distinctive charge regions in transcription factors and protooncogene products, pronounced hydrophobic segments in various receptor and transport proteins, and statistically significant subalignments involving the recently characterized cystic fibrosis gene.}},

                In theory, a comparison of two experimental effects requires a statistical test on their difference. In practice, this comparison is often based on an incorrect procedure involving two separate tests in which researchers conclude that effects differ when one effect is significant (P < 0.05) but the other is not (P > 0.05). We reviewed 513 behavioral, systems and cognitive neuroscience articles in five top-ranking journals (Science, Nature, Nature Neuroscience, Neuron and The Journal of Neuroscience) and found that 78 used the correct procedure and 79 used the incorrect procedure. An additional analysis suggests that incorrect analyses of interactions are even more common in cellular and molecular neuroscience. We discuss scenarios in which the erroneous procedure is particularly beguiling.

The maximum exponential rate of growth of the gambler's capital is equal to the rate of transmission of information over the channel. This result is generalized to include the case of arbitrary odds. Thus we find a situation in which the transmission rate has significance even though no coding is contemplated. Previously this quantity was given significance only by a theorem of Shannon's which asserted that, with suitable encoding, binary digits could be transmitted over the channel at this rate with an arbitrarily small probability of error.}},

From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.}},

    abstract = {{Despite recent advances in uncovering the quantitative features of stationary human activity patterns, many applications, from pandemic prediction to emergency response, require an understanding of how these patterns change when the population encounters unfamiliar conditions. To explore societal response to external perturbations we identified real-time changes in communication and mobility patterns in the vicinity of eight emergencies, such as bomb attacks and earthquakes, comparing these with eight non-emergencies, like concerts and sporting events. We find that communication spikes accompanying emergencies are both spatially and temporally localized, but information about emergencies spreads globally, resulting in communication avalanches that engage in a significant manner the social network of eyewitnesses. These results offer a quantitative view of behavioral changes in human activity under extreme conditions, with potential long-term impact on emergency detection and response.}},

    abstract = {{Common human diseases result from the interplay of many genes and environmental factors. Therefore, a more integrative biology approach is needed to unravel the complexity and causes of such diseases. To elucidate the complexity of common human diseases such as obesity, we have analysed the expression of 23,720 transcripts in large population-based blood and adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed for various phenotypes, including traits related to clinical obesity. In contrast to the blood expression profiles, we observed a marked correlation between gene expression in adipose tissue and obesity-related traits. Genome-wide linkage and association mapping revealed a highly significant genetic component to gene expression traits, including a strong genetic effect of proximal (cis) signals, with 50\% of the cis signals overlapping between the two tissues profiled. Here we demonstrate an extensive transcriptional network constructed from the human adipose data that exhibits significant overlap with similar network modules constructed from mouse adipose data. A core network module in humans and mice was identified that is enriched for genes involved in the inflammatory and immune response and has been found to be causally associated to obesity-related traits.}},

    abstract = {{To study the protein structure–function relationship, we propose a method to efficiently create three-dimensional maps of structure space using a very large dataset of > 30,000 Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) domains. In our maps, each domain is represented by a point, and the distance between any two points approximates the structural distance between their corresponding domains. We use these maps to study the spatial distributions of properties of proteins, and in particular those of local vicinities in structure space such as structural density and functional diversity. These maps provide a unique broad view of protein space and thus reveal previously undescribed fundamental properties thereof. At the same time, the maps are consistent with previous knowledge (e.g., domains cluster by their SCOP class) and organize in a unified, coherent representation previous observation concerning specific protein folds. To investigate the function–structure relationship, we measure the functional diversity (using the Gene Ontology controlled vocabulary) in local structural vicinities. Our most striking finding is that functional diversity varies considerably across structure space: The space has a highly diverse region, and diversity abates when moving away from it. Interestingly, the domains in this region are mostly alpha/beta structures, which are known to be the most ancient proteins. We believe that our unique perspective of structure space will open previously undescribed ways of studying proteins, their evolution, and the relationship between their structure and function.}},

    abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are regularly used to map genomic regions contributing to common human diseases, but they often do not identify the precise causative genes and sequence variants. To identify causative type 1 diabetes (T1D) variants, we resequenced exons and splice sites of 10 candidate genes in pools of DNA from 480 patients and 480 controls and tested their disease association in over 30,000 participants. We discovered four rare variants that lowered T1D risk independently of each other (odds ratio = 0.51 to 0.74; P = 1.3 × 10–3 to 2.1 × 10–16) in IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1), a gene located in a region previously associated with T1D by GWASs. These variants are predicted to alter the expression and structure of IFIH1 [MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5)], a cytoplasmic helicase that mediates induction of interferon response to viral RNA. This finding firmly establishes the role of IFIH1 in T1D and demonstrates that resequencing studies can pinpoint disease-causing genes in genomic regions initially identified by GWASs.}},

The past history of the developed world suggests that these problems require more capable governments that use a combination of economic and engineering solutions.

An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G>A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

    abstract = {{Common diseases such as type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease result from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Recent developments in genomics research have boosted progress in the discovery of susceptibility genes and fueled expectations about opportunities of genetic profiling for personalizing medicine. Personalized medicine requires a test that fairly accurately predicts disease risk, particularly when interventions are invasive, expensive or have major side effects. Recent studies on the prediction of common diseases based on multiple genetic variants alone or in addition to traditional disease risk factors showed limited predictive value so far, but all have investigated only a limited number of susceptibility variants. New gene discoveries from genome-wide association studies will certainly further improve the prediction of common diseases, but the question is whether this improvement is sufficient to enable personalized medicine. In this paper, we argue that new gene discoveries may not evidently improve the prediction of common diseases to a degree that it will change the management of individuals at increased risk. Substantial improvements may only be expected if we manage to understand the complete causal mechanisms of common diseases to a similar extent as we understand those of monogenic disorders. Genomics research will contribute to this understanding, but it is likely that the complexity of complex diseases may ultimately limit the opportunities for accurate prediction of disease in asymptomatic individuals as unraveling their complete causal pathways may be impossible.}},

We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell tumors (SRBCTs) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The ANNs correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy.}},

    abstract = {{This study examines a variety of artificial neural network (ANN) models in terms of their classification efficiency in an orthopedic disease, namely osteoporosis. Osteoporosis risk prediction may be viewed as a pattern classification problem, based on a set of clinical parameters. Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) were used in order to face the osteoporosis risk factor prediction. This approach is the first computational intelligence technique based on ANNs for osteoporosis risk study on Greek population. MLPs and PNNs are both feed-forward networks; however, their modus operandi is different. Various MPL architectures were examined after modifying the number of nodes in the hidden layer, the transfer functions and the learning algorithms. Moreover, PNNs were implemented with spread values ranging from 0.1 to 50, and 4 or 2 neurons in output layer, according to coding of osteoporosis desired outcome. The obtained results lead to the conclusion that the PNNs outperform to MLPs, thus they are proved as appropriate computation intelligence technique for osteoporosis risk factor prediction. Furthermore, the overfitting problem was more frequent to MLPs, contrary to PNNs as their spread value increased. The aim of proposed PNN is to assist specialists in osteoporosis prediction, avoiding unnecessary further testing with bone densitometry.}},

                The molecular biology revolution led to an intense focus on the study of interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the cell. One consequence of this focus was a reduced attention to whole-system physiology, making it difficult to link molecular biology to clinical medicine. Equipped with the tools emerging from the genomics revolution, we are now in a position to link molecular states to physiological ones through the reverse engineering of molecular networks that sense DNA and environmental perturbations and, as a result, drive variations in physiological states associated with disease.

Here, we investigate the influence of rare and common genetic variants on gene expression patterns, using variants identified from sequencing data from the 1000 genomes project in an African and European population sample and gene expression data from lymphoblastoid cell lines. We detect comparable numbers of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) when compared to genotypes obtained from HapMap 3, but as many as 80\% of the top expression quantitative trait variants (eQTVs) discovered from 1000 genomes data are novel. The properties of the newly discovered variants suggest that mapping common causal regulatory variants is challenging even with full resequencing data; however, we observe significant enrichment of regulatory effects in splice-site and nonsense variants. Using RNA sequencing data, we show that 46.2\% of nonsynonymous variants are differentially expressed in at least one individual in our sample, creating widespread potential for interactions between functional protein-coding and regulatory variants. We also use allele-specific expression to identify putative rare causal regulatory variants. Furthermore, we demonstrate that outlier expression values can be due to rare variant effects, and we approximate the number of such effects harboured in an individual by effect size. Our results demonstrate that integration of genomic and RNA sequencing analyses allows for the joint assessment of genome sequence and genome function.}},

    abstract = {{Background—The objective of this study was to examine the association of Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach with other noncategorical prediction functions.Methods and Results—This work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to 74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P<.001). Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for other factors, ≈28\% of CHD events in men and 29\% in women were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (≥130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) was 27\% in men and 34\% in women.Conclusions—Recommended guidelines of blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without overt CHD.}},

    abstract = {{Association rules represent a promising technique to improve heart disease prediction. Unfortunately, when association rules are applied on a medical data set, they produce an extremely large number of rules. Most of such rules are medically irrelevant and the time required to find them can be impractical. A more important issue is that, in general, association rules are mined on the entire data set without validation on an independent sample. To solve these limitations, we introduce an algorithm that uses search constraints to reduce the number of rules, searches for association rules on a training set, and finally validates them on an independent test set. The medical significance of discovered rules is evaluated with support, confidence, and lift. Association rules are applied on a real data set containing medical records of patients with heart disease. In medical terms, association rules relate heart perfusion measurements and risk factors to the degree of disease in four specific arteries. Search constraints and test set validation significantly reduce the number of association rules and produce a set of rules with high predictive accuracy. We exhibit important rules with high confidence, high lift, or both, that remain valid on the test set on several runs. These rules represent valuable medical knowledge}},

    abstract = {{We present novel optimization-based classification models that are general purpose and suitable for developing predictive rules for large heterogeneous biological and medical data sets. Our predictive model simultaneously incorporates (1) the ability to classify any number of distinct groups; (2) the ability to incorporate heterogeneous types of attributes as input; (3) a high-dimensional data transformation that eliminates noise and errors in biological data; (4) the ability to incorporate constraints to limit the rate of misclassification, and a reserved-judgment region that provides a safeguard against over-training (which tends to lead to high misclassification rates from the resulting predictive rule); and (5) successive multi-stage classification capability to handle data points placed in the reserved judgment region. Application of the predictive model to a broad class of biological and medical problems is described. Applications include: the differential diagnosis of the type of erythemato-squamous diseases; genomic analysis and prediction of aberrant CpG island meythlation in human cancer; discriminant analysis of motility and morphology data in human lung carcinoma; prediction of ultrasonic cell disruption for drug delivery; identification of tumor shape and volume in treatment of sarcoma; multistage discriminant analysis of biomarkers for prediction of early atherosclerosis; fingerprinting of native and angiogenic microvascular networks for early diagnosis of diabetes, aging, macular degeneracy and tumor metastasis, and prediction of protein localization sites. In all these applications, the predictive model yields correct classification rates ranging from 80\% to 100\%. This provides motivation for pursuing its use as a medical diagnostic, monitoring and decision-making tool.}},

                In the last several years, a number of studies have described large-scale structural variation in several genomes. Traditionally, such methods have used whole-genome array comparative genome hybridization or single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect large regions subject to copy-number variation. Later techniques have been based on paired-end mapping of Sanger sequencing data, providing better resolution and accuracy. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, a new generation of methods is being developed to tackle the challenges of short reads, while taking advantage of the high coverage the new sequencing technologies provide. In this survey, we describe these methods, including their strengths and their limitations, and future research directions.

Concern exists regarding whether these functions can be generalized to other populations.Objective  To test the validity and transportability of the Framingham CHD prediction functions per a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop organized for this purpose.Design, Setting, and Subjects  Sex-specific CHD functions were derived from Framingham data for prediction of coronary death and myocardial infarction. These functions were applied to 6 prospectively studied, ethnically diverse cohorts (n = 23 424), including whites, blacks, Native Americans, Japanese American men, and Hispanic men: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987-1988), Physicians' Health Study (1982), Honolulu Heart Program (1980-1982), Puerto Rico Heart Health Program (1965-1968), Strong Heart Study (1989-1991), and Cardiovascular Health Study (1989-1990).Main Outcome Measures  The performance, or ability to accurately predict CHD risk, of the Framingham functions compared with the performance of risk functions developed specifically from the individual cohorts' data. Comparisons included evaluation of the equality of relative risks for standard CHD risk factors, discrimination, and calibration.Results  For white men and women and for black men and women the Framingham functions performed reasonably well for prediction of CHD events within 5 years of follow-up. Among Japanese American and Hispanic men and Native American women, the Framingham functions systematically overestimated the risk of 5-year CHD events. After recalibration, taking into account different prevalences of risk factors and underlying rates of developing CHD, the Framingham functions worked well in these populations.Conclusions  The sex-specific Framingham CHD prediction functions perform well among whites and blacks in different settings and can be applied to other ethnic groups after recalibration for differing prevalences of risk factors and underlying rates of CHD events.}},

    abstract = {{Identification of key factors associated with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and quantification of this risk using multivariable prediction algorithms are among the major advances made in preventive cardiology and cardiovascular epidemiology in the 20th century. The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.}},

A systematic search for these variants was recently made possible by the development of high-density arrays that permit the genotyping of hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms. We tested 392,935 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a French case–control cohort. Markers with the most significant difference in genotype frequencies between cases of type 2 diabetes and controls were fast-tracked for testing in a second cohort. This identified four loci containing variants that confer type 2 diabetes risk, in addition to confirming the known association with the TCF7L2 gene. These loci include a non-synonymous polymorphism in the zinc transporter SLC30A8, which is expressed exclusively in insulin-producing -cells, and two linkage disequilibrium blocks that contain genes potentially involved in -cell development or function (IDE–KIF11–HHEX and EXT2–ALX4). These associations explain a substantial portion of disease risk and constitute proof of principle for the genome-wide approach to the elucidation of complex genetic traits.}},

    abstract = {{A limited number of studies have assessed the risk of common diseases when combining information from several predisposing polymorphisms. In most cases, individual polymorphisms only moderately increase risk (\~{}20\%), and they are thought to be unhelpful in assessing individuals' risk clinically. The value of analyzing multiple alleles simultaneously is not well studied. This is often because, for any given disease, very few common risk alleles have been confirmed. Three common variants (Lys23 of KCNJ11, Pro12 of PPARG, and the T allele at rs7903146 of TCF7L2) have been shown to predispose to type 2 diabetes mellitus across many large studies. Risk allele frequencies ranged from 0.30 to 0.88 in controls. To assess the combined effect of multiple susceptibility alleles, we genotyped these variants in a large case-control study (3,668 controls versus 2,409 cases). Individual allele odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.14 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.23) to 1.48 (95\% CI, 1.36 to 1.60). We found no evidence of gene-gene interaction, and the risks of multiple alleles were consistent with a multiplicative model. Each additional risk allele increased the odds of type 2 diabetes by 1.28 (95\% CI, 1.21 to 1.35) times. Participants with all six risk alleles had an OR of 5.71 (95\% CI, 1.15 to 28.3) compared to those with no risk alleles. The 8.1\% of participants that were double-homozygous for the risk alleles at TCF7L2 and Pro12Ala had an OR of 3.16 (95\% CI, 2.22 to 4.50), compared to 4.3\% with no TCF7L2 risk alleles and either no or one Glu23Lys or Pro12Ala risk alleles. Combining information from several known common risk polymorphisms allows the identification of population subgroups with markedly differing risks of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those obtained using single polymorphisms. This approach may have a role in future preventative measures for common, polygenic diseases.}},

However, the advent of genome-scanning technologies has now uncovered an unexpectedly large extent of what we term 'structural variation' in the human genome. This comprises microscopic and, more commonly, submicroscopic variants, which include deletions, duplications and large-scale copy-number variants — collectively termed copy-number variants or copy-number polymorphisms — as well as insertions, inversions and translocations. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variants can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility.}},

This crisis has motivated the drive towards preventative medicine, where the primary concern is recognizing disease risk and taking action at the earliest signs. However, universal testing is neither time nor cost efficient. We propose CARE, a Collaborative Assessment and Recommendation Engine, which relies only on patient's medical history using ICD-9-CM codes in order to predict future disease risks. CARE uses collaborative filtering methods to predict each patient's greatest disease risks based on their own medical history and that of similar patients. We also describe an Iterative version, ICARE, which incorporates ensemble concepts for improved performance. Also, we apply time-sensitive modifications which make the CARE framework practical for realistic long-term use. These novel systems require no specialized information and provide predictions for medical conditions of all kinds in a single run. We present experimental results on a large Medicare dataset, demonstrating that CARE and ICARE perform well at capturing future disease risks.}},

    abstract = {{A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.}},

In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed.

Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms. In some cases, these measures perform much better than the methods previously used. In cases where traditional contingency table methods work well, the likelihood ratio tests described here are nearly identical.This paper describes the basis of a measure based on likelihood ratios that can be applied to the analysis of text.}},

Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.}},

                Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately 1.2 >1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display beta approximately 0.8 <1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which beta<1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.

Phones, cars and planes allowed people to have contact over substantial distances. But the mere fact that ties stretched over long distances does not tell us the extent to which distance mattered for contact and support in pre-Internet days. Although, scholars have mused about this question, they have not provided empirical evidence. This paper applies multi-level analysis to assess the extent contact and support declines with distance. It shows a marked drop in the frequency of face-to-face contact at about 5 miles. The frequency of contact continues to decrease steadily further away, with substantial declines happening at about 50 and 100 miles. Distance affects telephone contact somewhat differently, with a marked drop only happening at about 100 miles. Distance also has a significant impact on providing tangible support. As our data were gathered in 1978 in the Toronto area of East York, they allow comparisons with how relationships have changed in light of new forms of communication, such as the Internet and mobile phones.}},

    abstract = {{**Winner, 43rd Nikkei Prize for Excellent Books in Economic Science.**


Since 1990 there has been a renaissance of theoretical and empirical work on
the spatial aspects of the economy—that is, where economic activity occurs and
why. Using new tools—in particular, modeling techniques developed to analyze
industrial organization, international trade, and economic growth—this "new
economic geography" has emerged as one of the most exciting areas of
contemporary economics.


The authors show how seemingly disparate models reflect a few basic themes,
and in so doing they develop a common "grammar" for discussing a variety of
issues. They show how a common approach that emphasizes the three-way
interaction among increasing returns, transportation costs, and the movement
of productive factors can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban,
regional, and international economics. This book is the first to provide a
sound and unified explanation of the existence of large economic
agglomerations at various spatial scales.}},

These models have important implications in the design of location-based services, security intrusion detection, and social media supporting local communities. Using user-supplied address data and the network of associations between members of the Facebook social network, we can directly observe and measure the relationship between geography and friendship. Using these measurements, we introduce an algorithm that predicts the location of an individual from a sparse set of located users with performance that exceeds IP-based geolocation.

                The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.

    abstract = {{In radiology, appropriate diagnoses are often based on quantitative data. However, these data contain inherent variability. Radiologists often see P values in the literature but are less familiar with other ways of reporting statistics. Statistics such as the SD and standard error of the mean (SEM) are commonly used in radiology, whereas the CI is not often used. Because the SEM is smaller than the SD, it is often inappropriately used in order to make the variability of the data look tighter. However, unlike the SD, which quantifies the variability of the actual data for a single sample, the SEM represents the precision for an estimated mean of a general population taken from many sample means. Since readers are usually interested in knowing about the variability of the single sample, the SD often is the preferred statistic. Statistical calculations combine sample size and variability (ie, the SD) to generate a CI for a population proportion or population mean. CIs enable researchers to estimate population values without having data from all members of the population. In most cases, CIs are based on a 95\% confidence level. The advantage of CIs over significance tests (P values) is that the CIs shift the interpretation from a qualitative judgment about the role of chance to a quantitative estimation of the biologic measure of effect. Proper understanding and use of these fundamental statistics and their calculations will allow more reliable analysis, interpretation, and communication of clinical information among health care providers and between these providers and their patients.}},

We show that patterns of intraurban movement are strongly heterogeneous in terms of volume, but not in terms of distance travelled, and that there is a polycentric structure composed of large flows organized around a limited number of activity centers. For smaller flows, the pattern of connections becomes richer and more complex and is not strictly hierarchical since it mixes different levels consisting of different orders of magnitude. This new understanding can shed light on the impact of new urban projects on the evolution of the polycentric configuration of a city and the dense structure of its centers and it provides an initial approach to modeling flows in an urban system.}},

    abstract = {{Many complex systems are organized in the form of a network embedded in space. Important examples include the physical Internet infrastucture, road networks, flight connections, brain functional networks, and social networks. The effect of space on network topology has recently come under the spotlight because of the emergence of pervasive technologies based on geolocalization, which constantly fill databases with people's movements and thus reveal their trajectories and spatial behavior. Extracting patterns and regularities from the resulting massive amount of human mobility data requires the development of appropriate tools for uncovering information in spatially embedded networks. In contrast with most works that tend to apply standard network metrics to any type of network, we argue in this paper for a careful treatment of the constraints imposed by space on network topology. In particular, we focus on the problem of community detection and propose a modularity function adapted to spatial networks. We show that it is possible to factor out the effect of space in order to reveal more clearly hidden structural similarities between the nodes. Methods are tested on a large mobile phone network and computer-generated benchmarks where the effect of space has been incorporated.}},

    abstract = {{Influence maximization is an interesting and well-motivated problem in social networks study. The traditional influence maximization problem is defined as finding the most "influential" vertices without considering the vertex attribute. Though it is useful, in practice, there exist different attributes for vertices, e.g., mobile phone social networks. So, it is more important and useful to capture the vertices having the maximum influence in different search categories, which is exactly the problem that we study in this work. Thus, we name this new problem as Categorical Influence Maximization (CIM). Compare with identifying maximum influence vertices in a single category social network, CIM is much harder because we have to deal with large scale complex data. In this work, based on the observations from real mobile phone social network data, we propose a Probability Distribution based Search method (PDS) to tackle the CIM problem. Specifically, the PDS method consists of three steps. First, we propose a probability distribution based parameter free method (PD-max) to identify the maximum influential vertex set for the specified category by studying the categorical influential distribution within a time interval. Second, among these detected influential vertices, we design a probability distribution based minimizing method (PD-minmax) to find the minimum number of vertices in each category having the maximum influences. We test our solutions with real data sets, which were collected for one year in a city in China. The extensive experiment results show that our methods outperform the existing ones.}},

    abstract = {{Identifying hot spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many smart city applications. The practical research on hot spots in smart city presents many unique features, such as highly mobile environments, supremely limited size of sample objects, and the non-uniform, biased samples. All these features have raised new challenges that make the traditional density-based clustering algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of objects, making the results less meaningful. In this paper we propose a novel, non-density-based approach called mobility-based clustering. The key idea is that sample objects are employed as "sensors" to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility, rather than the "object representatives". As such the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated. Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate these effects are proposed. We evaluate the performance of mobility-based clustering based on real traffic situations. Experimental results show that using 0.3\% of vehicles as the samples, mobility-based clustering can accurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by the latest representative algorithm UMicro.}},

Based on mining several million citations, we quantitatively analyze the processes driving paradigm shifts in science. We find that groundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize Laureates and other famous scientists are not only acknowledged by many citations of their landmark papers. Surprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous publications. Given that innovations must outcompete the rich-gets-richer effect for scientific citations, it turns out that they can make their way only through citation cascades. A quantitative analysis reveals how and why they happen. Science appears to behave like a self-organized critical system, in which citation cascades of all sizes occur, from continuous scientific progress all the way up to scientific revolutions, which change the way we see our world. Measuring the  ” boosting effect” of landmark papers, our analysis reveals how new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world dominated by established paradigms. The underlying  ” boost factor” is also useful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than through classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread method to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the distribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective social behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics perspective. Understanding the origin of scientific authority may therefore ultimately help to explain how social influence comes about and why the value of goods depends so strongly on the attention they attract.}},

Numbers of subjects with and without the outcome of interest are listed for each treatment or risk factor group. By using the study sample data thus tabulated, investigators quantify the association between treatment or risk factor and outcome. Three simple statistical calculations are used for this purpose: difference in proportions, relative risk, and odds ratio. The appropriate use of these statistics to estimate the association between treatment or risk factor and outcome in the relevant population depends on the design of the research. Herein, the enumeration of proportions, odds ratios, and risks and the relationships between them are demonstrated, along with guidelines for use and interpretation of these statistics appropriate to the type of study that gives rise to the data.}},

We investigated the prevalence of overweight and obesity and their relationship with 14 groups of chronic diseases in a Mediterranean population using data from the Italian National Survey collected in 1999-2000.METHODS:A sample of 52,300 families was randomly selected using a complex stratified multistage design, within strata of geographical areas, municipalities, and household sizes, to produce estimates representative of the whole Italian population. Data were collected by civil servants both with an interview and a self-reported questionnaire.RESULTS:The present study documents an increase in the prevalence of overweight among Italian adults in the last decades and an increased prevalence of several chronic conditions in obese or overweight individuals. A general pattern of a positive association between excess weight and chronic disease was observed for both sexes. The ratio of the prevalences of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases was higher in obese versus normal-weight individuals in the age group under 45 years.CONCLUSION:To reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases a policy promoting a healthier individual lifestyle is becoming more and more desirable.}},

    abstract = {{Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.}},

    abstract = {{When a disease breaks out in a human population, changes in behavior in response to the outbreak can alter the progression of the infectious agent. In particular, people aware of a disease in their proximity can take measures to reduce their susceptibility. Even if no centralized information is provided about the presence of a disease, such awareness can arise through first-hand observation and word of mouth. To understand the effects this can have on the spread of a disease, we formulate and analyze a mathematical model for the spread of awareness in a host population, and then link this to an epidemiological model by having more informed hosts reduce their susceptibility. We find that, in a well-mixed population, this can result in a lower size of the outbreak, but does not affect the epidemic threshold. If, however, the behavioral response is treated as a local effect arising in the proximity of an outbreak, it can completely stop a disease from spreading, although only if the infection rate is below a threshold. We show that the impact of locally spreading awareness is amplified if the social network of potential infection events and the network over which individuals communicate overlap, especially so if the networks have a high level of clustering. These findings suggest that care needs to be taken both in the interpretation of disease parameters, as well as in the prediction of the fate of future outbreaks.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper I develop a model that describes an evolutionary epidemiological mechanism and apply this model to the epidemiology of type A influenza. This evolutionary epidemiological model differs from the classical nonevolutionary epidemiological model which has been applied to diseases like measles, rubella, and whooping cough in having a novel mechanism which causes susceptible individuals to be introduced into the host population. In the nonevolutionary model, susceptibles are continually introduced into the host population by demographic processes: most hosts that die are immune, while newborn hosts are susceptible. In this evolutionary model, the susceptible class is continually replenished because the pathogen changes genetically, and hence immunologically, from one epidemic to the next, causing previously immune hosts to become susceptible. I derive formulae which describe how the equilibrium number of infected hosts, the interepidemic period, and the probability that a host will become reinfected depend on the rate of amino acid substitution in the pathogen, m, a parameter describing the effect of these substitutions on host immunity, γ, as well as the host population size, N, and the recovery rate, r. To apply the model to influenza, I show how the nondimensional parameter = mγN/r2 may be estimated from four types of data. The methods are applied to several data sets, and I conclude that 1; sampling variation and inconsistencies between the various data sets do not permit to be estimated more precisely. The evolutionary epidemiological model has no threshold host population size, in contrast to the nonevolutionary model.}},

The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination.

    abstract = {{Population-level analyses often use average quantities to describe heterogeneous systems, particularly when variation does not arise from identifiable groups1, 2. A prominent example, central to our current understanding of epidemic spread, is the basic reproductive number, R 0, which is defined as the mean number of infections caused by an infected individual in a susceptible population3, 4. Population estimates of R 0 can obscure considerable individual variation in infectiousness, as highlighted during the global emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by numerous 'superspreading events' in which certain individuals infected unusually large numbers of secondary cases5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For diseases transmitted by non-sexual direct contacts, such as SARS or smallpox, individual variation is difficult to measure empirically, and thus its importance for outbreak dynamics has been unclear2, 10, 11. Here we present an integrated theoretical and statistical analysis of the influence of individual variation in infectiousness on disease emergence. Using contact tracing data from eight directly transmitted diseases, we show that the distribution of individual infectiousness around R 0 is often highly skewed. Model predictions accounting for this variation differ sharply from average-based approaches, with disease extinction more likely and outbreaks rarer but more explosive. Using these models, we explore implications for outbreak control, showing that individual-specific control measures outperform population-wide measures. Moreover, the dramatic improvements achieved through targeted control policies emphasize the need to identify predictive correlates of higher infectiousness. Our findings indicate that superspreading is a normal feature of disease spread, and to frame ongoing discussion we propose a rigorous definition for superspreading events and a method to predict their frequency.}},

Many epidemiological models make simplifying assumptions about the patterns of disease-causing interactions among hosts. In particular, homogeneous-mixing models assume that all hosts have identical rates of disease-causing contacts. In recent years, several network-based approaches have been developed to explicitly model heterogeneity in host contact patterns. Here, we use a network perspective to quantify the extent to which real populations depart from the homogeneous-mixing assumption, in terms of both the underlying network structure and the resulting epidemiological dynamics. We find that human contact patterns are indeed more heterogeneous than assumed by homogeneous-mixing models, but are not as variable as some have speculated. We then evaluate a variety of methodologies for incorporating contact heterogeneity, including network-based models and several modifications to the simple SIR compartmental model. We conclude that the homogeneous-mixing compartmental model is appropriate when host populations are nearly homogeneous, and can be modified effectively for a few classes of non-homogeneous networks. In general, however, network models are more intuitive and accurate for predicting disease spread through heterogeneous host populations.}},

Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93\% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.}},

With scant information about a target individual, people can successively forward a message along such a chain. Experimental studies have verified this property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.}},

    abstract = {{As research expands in multiagent intelligent systems, investigators need new tools for evaluating the artificial societies they study. It is impossible, for example, to correlate heterogeneity with performance in multiagent robotics without a quantitative metric of diversity. Currently diversity is evaluated on a bipolar scale with systems classified as either heterogeneous or homogeneous, depending on whether any of the agents differ. Unfortunately, this labeling doesn't tell us much about the extent of diversity in heterogeneous teams. How can it be determined if one system is more or less diverse than another? Heterogeneity must be evaluated on a continuous scale to enable substantive comparisons between systems. To enable these types of comparisons, we introduce: (1) a continuous measure of robot behavioral difference, and (2) hierarchic social entropy, an application of Shannon's information entropy metric to robotic groups that provides a continuous, quantitative measure of robot team diversity. The metric captures important components of the meaning of diversity, including the number and size of behavioral groups in a society and the extent to which agents differ. The utility of the metrics is demonstrated in the experimental evaluation of multirobot soccer and multirobot foraging teams.}},

    abstract = {{Among the realistic ingredients to be considered in the computational modeling of infectious diseases, human mobility represents a crucial challenge both on the theoretical side and in view of the limited availability of empirical data. To study the interplay between short-scale commuting flows and long-range airline traffic in shaping the spatiotemporal pattern of a global epidemic we (i) analyze mobility data from 29 countries around the world and find a gravity model able to provide a global description of commuting patterns up to 300 kms and (ii) integrate in a worldwide-structured metapopulation epidemic model a timescale-separation technique for evaluating the force of infection due to multiscale mobility processes in the disease dynamics. Commuting flows are found, on average, to be one order of magnitude larger than airline flows. However, their introduction into the worldwide model shows that the large-scale pattern of the simulated epidemic exhibits only small variations with respect to the baseline case where only airline traffic is considered. The presence of short-range mobility increases, however, the synchronization of subpopulations in close proximity and affects the epidemic behavior at the periphery of the airline transportation infrastructure. The present approach outlines the possibility for the definition of layered computational approaches where different modeling assumptions and granularities can be used consistently in a unifying multiscale framework.}},

    abstract = {{Co-authorship networks, where the nodes are authors and a link indicates joint publications, are very helpful representations for studying the processes that shape the scientific community. At the same time, they are social networks with a large amount of data available and can thus serve as vehicles for analyzing social phenomena in general. Previous work on co-authorship networks concentrates on statistical properties on the scale of individual authors and individual publications within the network (e.g., citation distribution, degree distribution), on properties of the network as a whole (e.g., modularity, connectedness), or on the topological function of single authors (e.g., distance, betweenness). Here we show that the success of individual authors or publications depends unexpectedly strongly on an intermediate scale in co-authorship networks. For two large-scale data sets, CiteSeerX and DBLP, we analyze the correlation of (three- and four-node) network motifs with citation frequencies. We find that the average citation frequency of a group of authors depends on the motifs these authors form. In particular, a box motif (four authors forming a closed chain) has the highest average citation frequency per link. This result is robust across the two databases, across different ways of mapping the citation frequencies of publications onto the (uni-partite) co-authorship graph, and over time. We also relate this topological observation to the underlying social and socio-scientific processes that have been shaping the networks. We argue that the box motif may be an interesting category in a broad range of social and technical networks.}},

    abstract = {{A key aim in epidemiology is to understand how pathogens spread within their host populations. Central to this is an elucidation of a pathogen's transmission dynamics. Mathematical models have generally assumed that either contact rate between hosts is linearly related to host density (density-dependent) or that contact rate is independent of density (frequency-dependent), but attempts to confirm either these or alternative transmission functions have been rare. Here, we fit infection equations to 6 years of data on cowpox virus infection (a zoonotic pathogen) for 4 natural populations to investigate which of these transmission functions is best supported by the data. We utilize a simple reformulation of the traditional transmission equations that greatly aids the estimation of the relationship between density and host contact rate. Our results provide support for an infection rate that is a saturating function of host density. Moreover, we find strong support for seasonality in both the transmission coefficient and the relationship between host contact rate and host density, probably reflecting seasonal variations in social behavior and/or host susceptibility to infection. We find, too, that the identification of an appropriate loss term is a key component in inferring the transmission mechanism. Our study illustrates how time series data of the host–pathogen dynamics, especially of the number of susceptible individuals, can greatly facilitate the fitting of mechanistic disease models.}},

Then, for a scientist collaboration web and a stock correlation graph we compute three-link weight correlations and with the CPMw the weighted modules. After reshuffling link weights in both networks and computing the same quantities for the randomized control graphs as well, we show that groups of three or more strong links prefer to cluster together in both original graphs.}},

    abstract = {{Quantifying long-range dissemination of infectious diseases is a key issue in their dynamics and control. Here, we use influenza-related mortality data to analyze the between-state progression of interpandemic influenza in the United States over the past 30 years. Outbreaks show hierarchical spatial spread evidenced by higher pairwise synchrony between more populous states. Seasons with higher influenza mortality are associated with higher disease transmission and more rapid spread than are mild ones. The regional spread of infection correlates more closely with rates of movement of people to and from their workplaces (workflows) than with geographical distance. Workflows are described in turn by a gravity model, with a rapid decay of commuting up to around 100 km and a long tail of rare longer range flow. A simple epidemiological model, based on the gravity formulation, captures the observed increase of influenza spatial synchrony with transmissibility; high transmission allows influenza to spread rapidly beyond local spatial constraints.}},

    abstract = {{Planning for a possible influenza pandemic is an extremely high priority, as social and economic effects of an unmitigated pandemic would be devastating. Mathematical models can be used to explore different scenarios and provide insight into potential costs, benefits, and effectiveness of prevention and control strategies under consideration. A stochastic, equation-based epidemic model is used to study global transmission of pandemic flu, including the effects of travel restrictions and vaccination. Economic costs of intervention are also considered. The distribution of First Passage Times (FPT) to the United States and the numbers of infected persons in metropolitan areas worldwide are studied assuming various times and locations of the initial outbreak. International air travel restrictions alone provide a small delay in FPT to the U.S. When other containment measures are applied at the source in conjunction with travel restrictions, delays could be much longer. If in addition, control measures are instituted worldwide, there is a significant reduction in cases worldwide and specifically in the U.S. However, if travel restrictions are not combined with other measures, local epidemic severity may increase, because restriction-induced delays can push local outbreaks into high epidemic season. The per annum cost to the U.S. economy of international and major domestic air passenger travel restrictions is minimal: on the order of 0.8\% of Gross National Product. International air travel restrictions may provide a small but important delay in the spread of a pandemic, especially if other disease control measures are implemented during the afforded time. However, if other measures are not instituted, delays may worsen regional epidemics by pushing the outbreak into high epidemic season. This important interaction between policy and seasonality is only evident with a global-scale model. Since the benefit of travel restrictions can be substantial while their costs are minimal, dismissal of travel restrictions as an aid in dealing with a global pandemic seems premature.}},

shows that although providing such information beginning as early as possible

    abstract = {{The recent emergence of hypervirulent subtypes of avian influenza has underlined the potentially devastating effects of pandemic influenza. Were such a virus to acquire the ability to spread efficiently between humans, control would almost certainly be hampered by limited vaccine supplies unless global spread could be substantially delayed. Moreover, the large increases that have occurred in international air travel might be expected to lead to more rapid global dissemination than in previous pandemics. To evaluate the potential of local control measures and travel restrictions to impede global dissemination, we developed stochastic models of the international spread of influenza based on extensions of coupled epidemic transmission models. These models have been shown to be capable of accurately forecasting local and global spread of epidemic and pandemic influenza. We show that under most scenarios restrictions on air travel are likely to be of surprisingly little value in delaying epidemics, unless almost all travel ceases very soon after epidemics are detected. Interventions to reduce local transmission of influenza are likely to be more effective at reducing the rate of global spread and less vulnerable to implementation delays than air travel restrictions. Nevertheless, under the most plausible scenarios, achievable delays are small compared with the time needed to accumulate substantial vaccine stocks.}},

One of the most important methods to study diseases' relationships is to calculate their phenotype similarity scores based on the text and clinical synopsis parts of their records in the OMIM database. However, as demonstrated in this paper, the similarity score between two diseases is highly dependent on the numbers of medical terms in the records describing the diseases (termed as record size). Because the descriptions of some diseases tend to be more detailed due to research biases, the similarity scores between these diseases tend to be larger. Thus, applications based on this phenotype similarity measure are problematic. In this paper, we also discuss some reasonable approaches to study the relationships between diseases, which may avoid the biased applications of disease similarity scores.}},

ELM is a new approach for learning the parameters of the hidden layers of a multilayer neural network (as the multilayer perceptron or the radial basis function neural network). Its main advantage is the lower computational cost, which is especially relevant when dealing with many patterns defined in a high-dimensional space. This brief proposes a Bayesian approach to ELM, which presents some advantages over other approaches: it allows the introduction of a priori knowledge; obtains the confidence intervals (CIs) without the need of applying methods that are computationally intensive, e.g., bootstrap; and presents high generalization capabilities. Bayesian ELM is benchmarked against classical ELM in several artificial and real datasets that are widely used for the evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Achieved results show that the proposed approach produces a competitive accuracy with some additional advantages, namely, automatic production of CIs, reduction of probability of model overfitting, and use of a priori knowledge.}},

Mechanisms that may underlie the coexistence of 2 or more conditions in a patient (direct causation, associated risk factors, heterogeneity, independence) are examined, and the implications for clinical care considered. We conclude that the more precise use of constructs, as proposed in this article, would lead to improved research into the phenomenon of ill health in clinical care, epidemiology, and health services.}},

    abstract = {{Visualization of graphs containing many nodes and edges efficiently is quite challenging since representations generally suffer from visual clutter induced by the large amount of edge crossings and node-edge overlaps. That problem becomes even more important when nodes positions are fixed, such as in geography were nodes positions are set according to geographical coordinates. Edge bundling techniques can help to solve this issue by visually merging edges along common routes but it can also help to reveal high-level edge patterns in the network and therefore to understand its overall organization. In this paper, we present a generalization of [18] to reduce the clutter in a 3D representation by routing edges into bundles as well as a GPU-based rendering method to emphasize bundles densities while preserving edge color. To visualize geographical networks in the context of the globe, we also provide a new technique allowing to bundle edges around and not across it.}},

    abstract = {{Interaction graphs are ubiquitous in many fields such as bioinformatics, sociology and physical sciences. There have been many studies in the literature targeted at studying and mining these graphs. However, almost all of them have studied these graphs from a static point of view. The study of the evolution of these graphs over time can provide tremendous insight on the behavior of entities, communities and the flow of information among them. In this work, we present an event-based characterization of critical behavioral patterns for temporally varying interaction graphs. We use nonoverlapping snapshots of interaction graphs and develop a framework for capturing and identifying interesting events from them. We use these events to characterize complex behavioral patterns of individuals and communities over time. We show how semantic information can be incorporated to reason about community-behavior events. We also demonstrate the application of behavioral patterns for the purposes of modeling evolution, link prediction and influence maximization. Finally, we present a diffusion model for evolving networks, based on our framework.}},

    abstract = {{Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While our
social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it has been
impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the nature of this
restriction on social group structure. We construct a social network of
individuals whose most frequent geographical locations are also known. We also
classify the individuals into groups according to a community detection
algorithm. We study the variation of geographical span for social groups of
varying sizes, and explore the relationship between topological positions and
geographic positions of their members. We find that small social groups are
geographically very tight, but become much more clumped when the group size
exceeds about 30 members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological
positions and geographic positions of individuals within network communities.
These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural and
spatial constraints.}},

several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air
traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of
scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in
four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth
sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical

A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins5, 6, industrial sectors7 and groups of people8, 9) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.}},

Here, from data collected during a H1N1 pandemic (pdm) influenza outbreak that started in an elementary school and spread in a semirural community in Pennsylvania, we quantify how transmission of influenza is affected by social networks. We set up a transmission model for which parameters are estimated from the data via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Sitting next to a case or being the playmate of a case did not significantly increase the risk of infection; but the structuring of the school into classes and grades strongly affected spread. There was evidence that boys were more likely to transmit influenza to other boys than to girls (and vice versa), which mimicked the observed assortative mixing among playmates. We also investigated the presence of abnormally high transmission occurring on specific days of the outbreak. Late closure of the school (i.e., when 27\% of students already had symptoms) had no significant impact on spread. School-aged individuals (6–18 y) facilitated the introduction and spread of influenza in households, but only about one in five cases aged >18 y was infected by a school-aged household member. This analysis shows the extent to which clearly defined social networks affect influenza transmission, revealing strong between-place interactions with back-and-forth waves of transmission between the school, the community, and the household.}},

A principal component analysis was made of these health indicators and two factors were retained. The first factor, which can be called a global health index, was used to compare the sexes and the age strata; it was thus found that men (those who survive) are generally healthier than the women, and that subjects from the lower-age strata are healthier than their older counterparts. The second factor is described as opposing physical health and dependence to mental health, the results of which were similar for both sexes, but differed according to the various age strata compared.}},

However, the collection of accurate income and consumption data requires extensive resources for household surveys. Given the increasingly routine application of principal components analysis (PCA) using asset data in creating socio-economic status (SES) indices, we review how PCA-based indices are constructed, how they can be used, and their validity and limitations. Specifically, issues related to choice of variables, data preparation and problems such as data clustering are addressed. Interpretation of results and methods of classifying households into SES groups are also discussed. PCA has been validated as a method to describe SES differentiation within a population. Issues related to the underlying data will affect PCA and this should be considered when generating and interpreting results.}},

    abstract = {{The use of networks to integrate different genetic, proteomic, and metabolic datasets has been proposed as a viable path toward elucidating the origins of specific diseases. Here we introduce a new phenotypic database summarizing correlations obtained from the disease history of more than 30 million patients in a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). We present evidence that the structure of the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing that (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already have; (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is different for patients of different genders and ethnicities; (3) patients diagnosed with diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less connected diseases; and (4) diseases that tend to be preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than diseases that precede other illnesses, and are associated with higher degrees of mortality. Our findings show that disease progression can be represented and studied using network methods, offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of human diseases. The dataset introduced here, released concurrently with this publication, represents the largest relational phenotypic resource publicly available to the research community.}},

    abstract = {{Motivation: To date, computational searches for cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) have relied on two methods. The first, phylogenetic footprinting, has been used to find CRMs in non-coding sequence, but does not directly link DNA sequence with spatio-temporal patterns of expression. The second, based on searches for combinations of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, has been employed in genome-wide discovery of similarly acting enhancers, but requires prior knowledge of the set of TFs acting at the CRM and the TFs' binding motifs.Results: We propose a method for CRM discovery that combines aspects of both approaches in an effort to overcome their individual limitations. By treating phylogenetically footprinted non-coding regions (PFRs) as proxies for CRMs, we endeavor to find PFRs near co-regulated genes that are comprised of similar short, conserved sequences. Using Markov chains as a convenient formulation to assess similarity, we develop a sampling algorithm to search a large group of PFRs for the most similar subset. When starting with a set of genes involved in Drosophila early blastoderm development and using phylogenetic comparisons of Drosophila melanogaster and D.pseudoobscura genomes, we show here that our algorithm successfully detects known CRMs. Further, we use our similarity metric, based on Markov chain discrimination, in a genome-wide search, and uncover additional known and many candidate early blastoderm CRMs.Availability: Software is available via http://arep.med.harvard.edu/enhancersSupplementary information: Can be accessed at http://arep.med.harvard.edu/enhancers}},

    abstract = {{Motivation:The popular BLAST algorithm is based on a local  similarity search strategy, so its high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) do not have global alignment information. When scientists use BLAST to search for a  target protein or DNA sequence in a huge database like the human genome map,  the existence of repeated fragments, homologues or pseudogenes in the genome  often makes the BLAST result filled with redundant HSPs. Therefore, we need  a computational strategy to alleviate this problem. Results: In the gene discovery group of Celera Genomics, I  developed a two-step method, i.e. a BLAST step plus an LIS step, to align thousands of cDNA and protein sequences into the human genome map. The LIS  step is based on a mature computational algorithm, Longest Increasing  Subsequence (LIS) algorithm. The idea is to use the LIS algorithm to find  the longest series of consecutive HSPs in the BLAST output. Such a BLAST+LIS  strategy can be used as an independent alignment tool or as a complementary tool for other alignment programs like Sim4 and GenWise. It can also work as  a general purpose BLAST result processor in all sorts of BLAST searches.  Two examples from Celera were shown in this paper.Contact: me@hongyu.org}},

In general, however, analyzing such a chain is computationally intractable for even moderately sized networks because of the explosion in the size of the state space. Asavathiratham introduced the influence model (IM) as a framework for overcoming such limitations. The IM imposes constraints on the update behavior of a network of automata, allowing efficient analysis while still permitting interesting global behavior. However, some of the constraints of the IM are unnecessarily restrictive. The generalized IM (GIM) presented here relaxes some restrictions of the IM, thereby permitting more complex behavior without losing many of the attractive properties of the IM and actually enabling simpler proofs of several results. The GIM is explained and illustrated in relation to the IM from a variety of different perspectives, including geometric. Several examples of GIMs are presented.}},

Recent developments in open source software, that is, the Hadoop project and associated software, provide a foundation for scaling to petabyte scale data warehouses on Linux clusters, providing fault-tolerant parallelized analysis on such data using a programming style named MapReduce.DESCRIPTION:An overview is given of the current usage within the bioinformatics community of Hadoop, a top-level Apache Software Foundation project, and of associated open source software projects. The concepts behind Hadoop and the associated HBase project are defined, and current bioinformatics software that employ Hadoop is described. The focus is on next-generation sequencing, as the leading application area to date.CONCLUSIONS:Hadoop and the MapReduce programming paradigm already have a substantial base in the bioinformatics community, especially in the field of next-generation sequencing analysis, and such use is increasing. This is due to the cost-effectiveness of Hadoop-based analysis on commodity Linux clusters, and in the cloud via data upload to cloud vendors who have implemented Hadoop/HBase; and due to the effectiveness and ease-of-use of the MapReduce method in parallelization of many data analysis algorithms.}},

    abstract = {{As Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza spreads around the globe, it strikes school-age children more often than adults. Although there is some evidence of pre-existing immunity among older adults, this alone may not explain the significant gap in age-specific infection rates. Based on a retrospective analysis of pandemic strains of influenza from the last century, we show that school-age children typically experience the highest attack rates in primarily naive populations, with the burden shifting to adults during the subsequent season. Using a parsimonious network-based mathematical model which incorporates the changing distribution of contacts in the susceptible population, we demonstrate that new pandemic strains of influenza are expected to shift the epidemiological landscape in exactly this way. Our analysis provides a simple demographic explanation for the age bias observed for H1N1/09 attack rates, and suggests that this bias may shift in coming months. These results have significant implications for the allocation of public health resources for H1N1/09 and future influenza pandemics.}},

    abstract = {{Songs of many songbird species consist of variable sequences of a finite
number of syllables. A common approach for characterizing the syntax of these
complex syllable sequences is to use transition probabilities between the
syllables. This is equivalent to the Markov model, in which each syllable is
associated with one state, and the transition probabilities between the states
do not depend on the state transition history. Here we analyze the song syntax
in a Bengalese finch. We show that the Markov model fails to capture the
statistical properties of the syllable sequences. Instead, a state transition
model that accurately describes the statistics of the syllable sequences
includes adaptation of the self-transition probabilities when states are
repeatedly revisited, and allows associations of more than one state to the
same syllable. Such a model does not increase the model complexity
significantly. Mathematically, the model is a partially observable Markov model
with adaptation (POMMA). The success of the POMMA supports the branching chain
network hypothesis of how syntax is controlled within the premotor song nucleus
HVC, and suggests that adaptation and many-to-one mapping from neural
substrates to syllables are important features of the neural control of complex
song syntax.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: While the use of spatially referenced data for the analysis of epidemiological data is growing, issues associated with selecting the appropriate geographic unit of analysis are also emerging. A particularly problematic unit is the ZIP code. Lacking standardization and highly dynamic in structure, the use of ZIP codes and ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) for the spatial analysis of disease present a unique challenge to researchers. Problems associated with these units for detecting spatial patterns of disease are explored. RESULTS: A brief review of ZIP codes and their spatial representation is conducted. Though frequently represented as polygons to facilitate analysis, ZIP codes are actually defined at a narrower spatial resolution reflecting the street addresses they serve. This research shows that their generalization as continuous regions is an imposed structure that can have serious implications in the interpretation of research results. ZIP codes areas and Census defined ZCTAs, two commonly used polygonal representations of ZIP code address ranges, are examined in an effort to identify the spatial statistical sensitivities that emerge given differences in how these representations are defined. Here, comparative analysis focuses on the detection of patterns of prostate cancer in New York State. Of particular interest for studies utilizing local, spatial statistical tests, is that differences in the topological structures of ZIP code areas and ZCTAs give rise to different spatial patterns of disease. These differences are related to the different methodologies used in the generalization of ZIP code information. Given the difficulty associated with generating ZIP code boundaries, both ZIP code areas and ZCTAs contain numerous representational errors which can have a significant impact on spatial analysis. While the use of ZIP code polygons for spatial analysis is relatively straightforward, ZCTA representations contain additional topological features (e.g. lakes and rivers) and contain fragmented polygons that can hinder spatial analysis. CONCLUSION: Caution must be exercised when using spatially referenced data, particularly that which is attributed to ZIP codes and ZCTAs, for epidemiological analysis. Researchers should be cognizant of representational errors associated with both geographies and their resulting spatial mismatch, especially when comparing the results obtained using different topological representations. While ZCTAs can be problematic, topological corrections are easily implemented in a geographic information system to remedy erroneous aggregation effects.}},

    abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We extend the MAXQ framework to the multi-agent case. Each agent uses the same MAXQ hierarchy to decompose a task into sub-tasks. Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with other agents. Coordination skills among agents are learned by using joint actions at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy. The Q nodes at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy are configured to represent the joint task-action space among multiple agents. In this approach, each agent only knows what other agents are doing at the level of sub-tasks, and is unaware of lower level (primitive) actions. This hierarchical approach allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of sub-tasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination taking into account primitive joint state-action values. We apply this hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to a complex AGV scheduling task and compare its performance and speed with other learning approaches, including flat multi-agent, single agent using MAXQ, selfish multiple agents using MAXQ (where each agent acts independently without communicating with the other agents), as well as several well-known AGV heuristics like "first come first serve", "highest queue first" and "nearest station first". We also compare the tradeoffs in learning speed vs. performance of modeling joint action values at multiple levels in the MAXQ hierarchy.}},

    abstract = {{For centuries, scientists have attempted to identify and document analytical laws that underlie physical phenomena in nature. Despite the prevalence of computing power, the process of finding natural laws and their corresponding equations has resisted automation. A key challenge to finding analytic relations automatically is defining algorithmically what makes a correlation in observed data important and insightful. We propose a principle for the identification of nontriviality. We demonstrated this approach by automatically searching motion-tracking data captured from various physical systems, ranging from simple harmonic oscillators to chaotic double-pendula. Without any prior knowledge about physics, kinematics, or geometry, the algorithm discovered Hamiltonians, Lagrangians, and other laws of geometric and momentum conservation. The discovery rate accelerated as laws found for simpler systems were used to bootstrap explanations for more complex systems, gradually uncovering the  ” alphabet” used to describe those systems.}},

Our approach is based on the construction of different types of weighted line graphs, i.e. graphs whose nodes are the links of the original graph, that encapsulate differently the relations between the edges. Weighted line graphs are argued to provide an alternative, valuable representation of the system's topology, and are shown to have important applications in community detection, as the usual node partition of a line graph naturally leads to an edge partition of the original graph. This identification allows us to use traditional partitioning methods in order to address the long-standing problem of the detection of overlapping communities.

However, its hyperparameter-estimating procedure may contain numerous matrix manipulations of O(N 3 ) arithmetic operations, in addition to the O(N 2 )-level storage. Motivated by handling the real-world large dataset of 24000 wind-turbine data, we propose in this paper an efficient and economical Toeplitz-computation scheme for time-series Gaussian process regression. The scheme is of O(N 2 ) operations and O(N)-level memory requirement. Numerical experiments substantiate the effectiveness and possibility of using this Toeplitz computation for very large datasets regression (such as, containing 10000\~{}100000 data points).}},

We analyzed 748 samples for size, mass, and material composition collected from surface net tows on 11 expeditions from Cape Cod, Massachusetts to the Caribbean Sea between 1991 and 2007. Particles were mostly fragments less than 10 mm in size with nearly all lighter than 0.05 g. Material densities ranged from 0.808 to 1.24 g ml −1 , with about half between 0.97 and 1.04 g ml −1 , a range not typically found in virgin plastics. Elemental analysis suggests that samples in this density range are consistent with polypropylene and polyethylene whose densities have increased, likely due to biofouling. Pelagic densities varied considerably from that of beach plastic debris, suggesting that plastic particles are modified during their residence at sea. These analyses provide clues in understanding particle fate and potential debris sources, and address ecological implications of pelagic plastic debris.}},

    abstract = {{As a social media, online social networks play a vital role in the social information diffusion. However, due to its unique complexity, the mechanism of the diffusion in online social networks is different from the ones in other types of networks and remains unclear to us. Meanwhile, few works have been done to reveal the coupled dynamics of both the structure and the diffusion of online social networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a model to investigate how the structure is coupled with the diffusion in online social networks from the view of weak ties. Through numerical experiments on large-scale online social networks, we find that in contrast to some previous research results, selecting weak ties preferentially to republish cannot make the information diffuse quickly, while random selection can achieve this goal. However, when we remove the weak ties gradually, the coverage of the information will drop sharply even in the case of random selection. We also give a reasonable explanation for this by extra analysis and experiments. Finally, we conclude that weak ties play a subtle role in the information diffusion in online social networks. On one hand, they act as bridges to connect isolated local communities together and break through the local trapping of the information. On the other hand, selecting them as preferential paths to republish cannot help the information spread further in the network. As a result, weak ties might be of use in the control of the virus spread and the private information diffusion in real-world applications.}},

    abstract = {{Empirical studies show that real world networks often exhibit multiple scales of topological descriptions. However, it is still an open problem how to identify the intrinsic multiple scales of networks. In this paper, we consider detecting the multiscale community structure of network from the perspective of dimension reduction. According to this perspective, a covariance matrix of network is defined to uncover the multiscale community structure through the translation and rotation transformations. It is proved that the covariance matrix is the unbiased version of the well-known modularity matrix. We then point out that the translation and rotation transformations fail to deal with the heterogeneous network, which is very common in nature and society. To address this problem, a correlation matrix is proposed through introducing the rescaling transformation into the covariance matrix. Extensive tests on real world and artificial networks demonstrate that the correlation matrix significantly outperforms the covariance matrix, identically the modularity matrix, as regards identifying the multiscale community structure of network. This work provides a novel perspective to the identification of community structure and thus various dimension reduction methods might be used for the identification of community structure. Through introducing the correlation matrix, we further conclude that the rescaling transformation is crucial to identify the multiscale community structure of network, as well as the translation and rotation transformations.}},

                Networks have become a key approach to understanding systems of interacting objects, unifying the study of diverse phenomena including biological organisms and human society. One crucial step when studying the structure and dynamics of networks is to identify communities: groups of related nodes that correspond to functional subunits such as protein complexes or social spheres. Communities in networks often overlap such that nodes simultaneously belong to several groups. Meanwhile, many networks are known to possess hierarchical organization, where communities are recursively grouped into a hierarchical structure. However, the fact that many real networks have communities with pervasive overlap, where each and every node belongs to more than one group, has the consequence that a global hierarchy of nodes cannot capture the relationships between overlapping groups. Here we reinvent communities as groups of links rather than nodes and show that this unorthodox approach successfully reconciles the antagonistic organizing principles of overlapping communities and hierarchy. In contrast to the existing literature, which has entirely focused on grouping nodes, link communities naturally incorporate overlap while revealing hierarchical organization. We find relevant link communities in many networks, including major biological networks such as protein-protein interaction and metabolic networks, and show that a large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city to regional scales while maintaining pervasive overlap. Our results imply that link communities are fundamental building blocks that reveal overlap and hierarchical organization in networks to be two aspects of the same phenomenon.

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm\"{o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni\~{n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880?1920 and 1960?90, and lower power during 1920?60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovm\"{o}ller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2?8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.}},

In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities2. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza3, 4. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users.}},

The statistical analysis of such data is often inadequate in two ways: it may fail to settle clinically relevant questions and it may be statistically invalid. A commonly used method which compares groups at a series of time points, possibly with t tests, is flawed on both counts. There may, however, be a remedy, which takes the form of a two stage method that uses summary measures. In the first stage a suitable summary of the response in an individual, such as a rate of change or an area under a curve, is identified and calculated for each subject. In the second stage these summary measures are analysed by simple statistical techniques as though they were raw data. The method is statistically valid and likely to be more relevant to the study questions. If this method is borne in mind when the experiment is being planned it should promote studies with enough subjects and sufficient observations at critical times to enable useful conclusions to be drawn.

Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps.

Metamodeling approaches have advantages over traditional techniques when dealing with the noisy responses and/or high computational cost characteristic of many computer simulations. This paper focuses on a particular algorithm, Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) that uses kriging metamodels. Several infill sampling criteria are reviewed, namely criteria for selecting design points at which the true functions are evaluated. The infill sampling criterion has a strong influence on how efficiently and accurately EGO locates the optimum. Variance-reducing criteria substantially reduce the RMS error of the resulting metamodels, while other criteria influence how locally or globally EGO searches. Criteria that place more emphasis on global searching require more iterations to locate optima and do so less accurately than criteria emphasizing local search.}},

We assign two weights on each edge to reflect the strength of social interaction, which are the aggregate call duration and the cumulative number of calls placed between the individuals over a period of 18 weeks. We present a detailed analysis of this weighted network by examining its degree, strength, and weight distributions, as well as its topological assortativity and weighted assortativity, clustering and weighted clustering, together with correlations between these quantities. We give an account of motif intensity and coherence distributions and compare them to a randomized reference system. We also use the concept of link overlap to measure the number of common neighbours any two adjacent nodes have, which serves as a useful local measure for identifying the interconnectedness of communities. We report a positive correlation between the overlap and weight of a link, thus providing strong quantitative evidence for the weak ties hypothesis, a central concept in social network analysis. The percolation properties of the network are found to depend on the type and order of removed links, and they can help understand how the local structure of the network manifests itself at the global level. We hope that our results will contribute to modelling weighted large-scale social networks, and believe that the systematic approach followed here can be adopted to study other weighted networks.}},

Software vendors are, however, still applying old usage rights models to a platform where application rights will be specified, managed and distributed in new and different ways. The characteristics of pervasive environments, such as occasional connectivity, require the introduction of more flexible usage rights models, such as audit-based model, that do not assume the availability of network connections. In this paper we describe a pervasive application rights management architecture for both desktop and mobile applications that provides an integrated platform for the specification, generation, delivery, and management of application usage rights based on Web services standards. We also introduce flexible usage rights models required by pervasive environments that can be embedded in target applications using aspect-oriented technology.}},

The algorithm converges online to the optimal control solution without knowledge of the internal system dynamics. Closed-loop dynamic stability is guaranteed throughout. The algorithm is based on a reinforcement learning scheme, namely Policy Iterations, and makes use of neural networks, in an Actor/Critic structure, to parametrically represent the control policy and the performance of the control system. The two neural networks are trained to express the optimal controller and optimal cost function which describes the infinite horizon control performance. Convergence of the algorithm is proven under the realistic assumption that the two neural networks do not provide perfect representations for the nonlinear control and cost functions. The result is a hybrid control structure which involves a continuous-time controller and a supervisory adaptation structure which operates based on data sampled from the plant and from the continuous-time performance dynamics. Such control structure is unlike any standard form of controllers previously seen in the literature. Simulation results, obtained considering two second-order nonlinear systems, are provided.}},

In the online NN reinforcement learning method, one NN is designated as the critic NN, which approximates the long-term cost function by assuming that the states of the nonlinear systems is available for measurement. An action NN is employed to derive an optimal control signal to track a desired system trajectory while minimizing the cost function. Online updating weight tuning schemes for these two NNs are also derived. By using the Lyapunov approach, the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking error and weight estimates is shown. Nanomanipulation implies manipulating objects with nanometer size. It takes several hours to perform a simple task in the nanoscale world. To accomplish the task automatically the proposed online learning control design is evaluated for the task of nanomanipulation and verified in the simulation environment}},

In particular, we show how constrained hubs - highly connected agents - can be beneficial in particular optimization problems.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract.\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Avalanches, or Avalanche-like, events are often observed in the dynamical behaviour of many complex systems which span from solar flaring to the Earth's crust dynamics and from traffic flows to financial markets. Self-organized criticality (SOC) is one of the most popular theories able to explain this intermittent charge/discharge behaviour. Despite a large amount of theoretical work, empirical tests for SOC are still in their infancy. In the present paper we address the common problem of revealing SOC from a simple time series without having much information about the underlying system. As a working example we use a modified version of the multifractal random walk originally proposed as a model for the stock market dynamics. The study reveals, despite the lack of the typical ingredients of SOC, an avalanche-like dynamics similar to that of many physical systems. While, on one hand, the results confirm the relevance of cascade models in representing turbulent-like phenomena, on the other, they also raise the question about the current state of reliability of SOC inference from time series analysis.}},

    abstract = {{In the past few decades considerable effort has been expended in
characterizing and modeling financial time series. A number of stylized facts
have been identified, and volatility clustering or the tendency toward
persistence has emerged as the central feature. In this paper we propose an
appropriately defined conditional probability as a new measure of volatility
clustering. We test this measure by applying it to different stock market data,
and we uncover a rich temporal structure in volatility fluctuations described
very well by a scaling relation. The scale factor used in the scaling provides
a direct measure of volatility clustering; such a measure may be used for
developing techniques for option pricing, risk management, and economic
forecasting. In addition, we present a stochastic volatility model that can
display many of the salient features exhibited by volatilities of empirical
financial time series, including the behavior of conditional probabilities that
we have deduced.}},

Patients with Parkinson's disease, who have depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia, are impaired in tasks that require learning from trial and error. Here, we show, using two cognitive procedural learning tasks, that Parkinson's patients off medication are better at learning to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes than they are at learning from positive outcomes. Dopamine medication reverses this bias, making patients more sensitive to positive than negative outcomes. This pattern was predicted by our biologically based computational model of basal ganglia–dopamine interactions in cognition, which has separate pathways for  ” Go” and  ” NoGo” responses that are differentially modulated by positive and negative reinforcement.}},

Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been gaining increasing attention among researchers and practitioners. However, they may execute for a long time for some difficult problems, because several evaluations must be performed. Moreover, the non-dominance checking and the non-dominated selection procedures are also very time consuming. From our experiments, more than 99\% of the execution time is used in performing the two procedures. A promising approach to overcome this limitation is to parallelize these algorithms. In this paper, we propose a parallel MOEA on consumer-level Graphics Processing Units (GPU). We perform many experiments on two-objective and three-objective benchmark problems to compare our parallel MOEA with a sequential MOEA and demonstrate that the former is much more efficient than the latter.}},

To achieve high computation speed, we propose a fast sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm, which is the core operation of iterative solvers. The proposed multiplication algorithm efficiently utilizes GPU resources via caching, coalesced memory accesses and load balance between running threads.

    abstract = {{This dissertation presents a platform for running experiments on multiagent reinforcement learning algorithms and an empirical evaluation that was conducted on the platform. The setting under consideration is game theoretic in which a single normal form game is repeatedly played. There has been a large body of work focusing on introducing new algorithms to achieve certain goals such as guaranteeing values in a game, converging to a Nash equilibrium or minimizing total regret. Currently, we have an understanding of how some of these algorithms work in limited settings, but lack a broader understanding of which algorithms perform well against each other and how they perform on a larger variety of games. We describe our development of a platform that allows large scale tests to be run, where multiple algorithms are played against one another on a variety of games. The platform has a set of builtin metrics that can be used to measure the performance of an algorithm, including convergence to a Nash equilibrium, regret, reward and number of wins. Visualising the results of the test can be automatically achieved through the platform, with all interaction taking place through graphical user interfaces. We also present the results of an empirical test that to our knowledge includes the largest combination of game instances and algorithms used in the multiagent learning literature. To demonstrate the usefulness of the platform, we provide evidence for a number of claims and hypotheses. This includes claims related to convergence to a Nash equilibrium, reward, regret and best response metrics and claims dealing with estimating an opponent's strategy. Some of our claims include that (1) no algorithm does best across all metrics and over all opponents, (2) algorithms do not often converge to an exact Nash equilibrium, but (3) do often reach a small window around a Nash equilibrium, (4) there is no apparent link between converging to a Nash equilibrium and obtaining high reward and (5) there is no linear trend between reward and the size of the game for any agent. The two major contributions of this work are a software platform for running large experimental tests and empirical results that provide insight into the performance of various algorithms.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract  In this paper we introduce a new multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, called exploring selfish reinforcement learning (ESRL). ESRL allows agents to reach optimal solutions in repeated non-zero sum games with stochastic rewards, by using coordinated exploration. First, two ESRL algorithms for respectively common interest and conflicting interest games are presented. Both ESRL algorithms are based on the same idea, i.e. an agent explores by temporarily excluding some of the local actions from its private action space, to give the team of agents the opportunity to look for better solutions in a reduced joint action space. In a latter stage these two algorithms are transformed into one generic algorithm which does not assume that the type of the game is known in advance. ESRL is able to find the Pareto optimal solution in common interest games without communication. In conflicting interest games ESRL only needs limited communication to learn a fair periodical policy, resulting in a good overall policy. Important to know is that ESRL agents are independent in the sense that they only use their own action choices and rewards to base their decisions on, that ESRL agents are flexible in learning different solution concepts and they can handle both stochastic, possible delayed rewards and asynchronous action selection. A real-life experiment, i.e. adaptive load-balancing of parallel applications is added.}},

    abstract = {{Periodical policies were recently introduced as a solution for the coordination problem in games which assume competition between the players, and where the overall performance can only be as good as the performance of the poorest player. Instead of converging to just one Nash equilibrium, which may favor just one of the players, a periodical policy switches between periods in which all interesting Nash equilibria are played. As a result the players are able to equalize their pay-offs and a fair solution is build. Moreover players can learn this policy with a minimum on communication; now and then they send each other their performance. In this paper, periodical policies are investigated for use in real-life asynchronous games. More precisely we look at the problem of load balancing in a simple job scheduling game. The asynchronism of the problem is reflected in delayed pay-offs or reinforcements, probabilistic job creation and processor rates which follow an exponential distribution. We show that a group of homo egualis reinforcement learning agents can still find a periodical policy. When the jobs are small, homo egualis reinforcement learning agents find a good probability distribution over their action space to play the game without any communication.}},

    abstract = {{We consider the problem of designing the the utility functions of the utility-maximizing agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) so that they work synergistically to maximize a global utility. The particular problem domain we explore is the control of network routing by placing agents on all the routers in the network. Conventional approaches to this task have the agents all use the Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA). We demonstrate that in many cases, due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's performance, having agents use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate cost is concerned, even when they are only used to route infinitesimally small amounts of traffic. The utility functions of the individual agents are not "aligned" with the global utility, intuitively speaking. As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess' paradox in which adding new links to a network whose agents all use the ISPA results in a decrease in overall throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the agents' decisions are collectively made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across time is concerned. This is also due to "side-effects", in this case of current routing decision on future traffic. The mathematics of Collective Intelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects in multi-agent systems, both over time and space. We present key concepts from that mathematics and use them to derive an algorithm whose ideal version should have better performance than that of having all agents use the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated via empirical means (a version potentially applicable in the real world) also outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In particular, this COIN algorithm almost always avoids Braess' paradox.}},

The Markov decision process (MDP) model is a popular way of formalizing the reinforcement-learning problem, but it is by no means the only way. In this paper, we show how many of the important theoretical results concerning reinforcement learning in MDPs extend to a generalized MDP model that includes MDPs, two-player games and MDPs under a worst-case optimality criterion as special cases. The basis of this extension is a stochastic-approximation theorem that reduces asynchronous convergence to synchronous convergence.

Thefirst volume consists of four parts. In Part 1 (Arrovian ImpossibilityTheorems), various aspects of Arrovian general impossibility theorems,illustrated by the simple majority cycle first identified by Condorcet, areexpounded and evaluated. It also provides a critical survey of the work ondifferent escape routes from impossibility results of this kind. In Part 2(Voting Schemes and Mechanisms), the operation and performance of votingschemes and cost-sharing mechanisms are examined axiomatically, and someaspects of the modern theory of incentives and mechanism design are expoundedand surveyed. In Part 3 (structure of social choice rules), the positionalrules of collective decision-making (the origin of which can be traced back toa seminal proposal by Borda), the game-theoretic aspects of voting incommittees, and the implications of making use of interpersonal comparisons ofwelfare (with or without cardinal measurability) are expounded, and the statusof utilitarianism as a theory of justice is critically examined. It alsoprovides an analytical survey of the foundations of measurement of inequalityand poverty. In order to place these broad issues (as well as further issuesto be discussed in the second volume of the Handbook) in perspective, KotaroSuzumura has written an extensive introduction, discussing the historicalbackground of social choice theory, the vistas opened by Arrow's Social Choiceand Individual Values, the famous "socialist planning" controversy, and thetheoretical and practical significance of social choice theory. The primarypurpose of this Handbook is to provide an accessible introduction to thecurrent state of the art in social choice theory and welfare economics. Theexpounded theory has a strong and constructive message for pursuing humanwell-being and facilitating collective decision-making.}},

Customers arrive according to some stochastic process (e.g., a Poisson process) and immediately upon arrival must join one of the queues, thereafter to be served on a first-come first-served basis, with no jockeying or defections allowed. The service times are independent and identically distributed with a known distribution. Moreover, the service times are independent of the arrival process and the customer decisions. The only information about the history of the system available for deciding which queue to join is the number of customers currently waiting and being served at each server. Joining the shortest queue is known to minimize each customer's individual expected delay and the long-run average delay per customer when the service-time distribution is exponential or has nondecreasing failure rate. We show that there are service-time distributions for which it is not optimal to always join the shortest queue. We also show that if, in addition, the elapsed service times of customers in service are known, the long-run average delay is not always minimized by customers joining the queue that minimizes their individual expected delays.}},

    abstract = {{Multiagent computing on a cluster of workstations is widely envisioned to be a powerful paradigm for building useful distributed applications. The agents of the system span across all the machines of a cluster. Just like the case of traditional distributed systems, load balancing becomes an area of concern. With different characteristics between ordinary processes and agents, it is both interesting and useful to investigate whether conventional load-balancing strategies are also applicable and sufficient to cope with the newly emerging needs, such as coping with temporally continuous agents, devising a performance metric for multiagent systems, and taking into account the vast amount of communication and interaction among agent. This paper discusses the above issues with reference to agent properties and load balancing techniques and outlines the space of load-balancing design choices in the arena of multiagent computing. In view of the special agent characteristics, a novel communication-based load-balancing algorithm is proposed, implemented, and evaluated. The proposed algorithm works by associating a credit value with each agent. The credit of an agent depends on its affinity to a machine, its current workload, its communication behavior, and mobility, etc. When a load imbalance occurs, the credits of all agents are examined and an agent with a lower credit value is migrated to relatively lightly loaded machine in the system. Quasi-simulated experiments of this algorithm show load-balancing improvement compared with conventional workload-oriented load-balancing schemes.}},

However, proposed service-oriented architectures are typically based on centralised components, such as service registries or service brokers, that introduce reliability, management, and performance issues. This paper describes an approach to fully decentralise a service-oriented architecture using a self-organising peer-to-peer network maintained by service providers and consumers. The design is based on a gradient peer-to-peer topology, which allows the system to replicate a service registry using a limited number of the most stable and best performing peers. The paper evaluates the proposed approach through extensive simulation experiments and shows that the decentralised registry and the underlying peer-to-peer infrastructure scale to a large number of peers and can successfully manage high peer churn rates.}},

    abstract = {{This paper considers a novel application domain for reinforcement learning: that of "autonomic computing," i.e. selfmanaging computing systems. RL is applied to an online resource allocation task in a distributed multi-application computing environment with independent time-varying load in each application. The task is to allocate servers in real time so as to maximize the sum of performance-based expected utility in each application. This task may be treated as a composite MDP, and to exploit the problem structure, a simple localized RL approach is proposed, with better scalability than previous approaches. The RL approach is tested in a realistic prototype data center comprising real servers, real HTTP requests, and realistic time-varying demand. This domain poses a number of major challenges associated with live training in a real system, including: the need for rapid training, exploration that avoids excessive penalties, and handling complex, potentially non-Markovian system effects. The early results are encouraging: in overnight training, RL performs as well as or slightly better than heavily researched model-based approaches derived from queuing theory.}},

    abstract = {{Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) has existed as a subfield of AI for less than two decades. DAI is concerned with systems that consist of multiple independent entities that interact in a domain. Traditionally, DAI has been divided into two sub-disciplines: Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) focuses on the information management aspects of systems with several components working together towards a common goal; Multiagent Systems (MAS) deals with behavior management in collections of several independent entities, or agents. This survey of MAS is intended to serve as an introduction to the field and as an organizational framework. A series of general multiagent scenarios are presented. For each scenario, the issues that arise are described along with a sampling of the techniques that exist to deal with them. The presented techniques are not exhaustive, but they highlight how multiagent systems can be and have been used to build complex systems. When options exist, the techniques presented are biased towards machine learning approaches. Additional opportunities for applying machine learning to MAS are highlighted and robotic soccer is presented as an appropriate test bed for MAS. This survey does not focus exclusively on robotic systems. However, we believe that much of the prior research in non-robotic MAS is relevant to robotic MAS, and we explicitly discuss several robotic MAS, including all of those presented in this issue.}},

    abstract = {{Large-scale simulation studies are necessary to study the learning behaviour of individual agents and the overall system dynamics. One reason is that planning algorithms to find optimal solutions to fully observable general decentralised Markov decision problems do not admit to polynomial-time worst-case complexity bounds. Additionally, agent interaction often implies a non-stationary environment which does not lend itself to asymptotically greedy policies. Therefore, policies with a constant level of exploration are required to be able to adapt continuously. This paper casts the application domain of distributed task assignment into the formalisms of queueing theory, complex networks and decentralised Markov decision problems to analyse the impact of the momentum of a standard back-propagation neural network function approximator and the discount factor of \$SARSA(0)\$ reinforcement learning and the \$\epsilon\$ parameter of the \$\epsilon\$-greedy policy. For this purpose large queueing networks of one thousand interacting agents are evolved. A Kriging metamodel is fitted and in combination with simulated annealing optimal operating conditions with respect to the total average response time are found. The insights gained from this study are significant in that they provide guidance in deploying large-scale distributed task assignment systems modelled as multi-agent queueing networks.}},

    abstract = {{Large scale simulation studies, such as routing in communication systems, rely on complex networks. However, the specific network structure of the application domain is often neglected in analysing network behaviour with the consequence of limited ability to conduct a sensitivity analyses. Network evolution models have been developed to account for structural properties of social graphs, such as the Internet, and enable a model-based analysis on different scales. Despite some analytical results with respect to queueing metrics, little work has been done to frame network evolution models in the context of queuing systems. This paper addresses this issue discussing social and random network evolution models and their application to queueing systems. When the stability criterion holds, analytical solutions using Jackson's Theorem and Little's Law exist and provide valuable insights into a number of queueing performance metrics. Specifically, a sensitivity analysis of the mean total waiting time versus the utilisation is carried out which shows a significant difference between the social and random network models. Understanding the impact of the structural features of complex networks is important in the design of simulation studies and operating real world systems. This is especially true when adaptive algorithms are employed and insights of their performance compared to analytical scenarios are required.}},

    abstract = {{Many algorithms for image processing and pattern recognition have recently been implemented on GPU (graphic processing unit) for faster computational times. However, the implementation using GPU encounters two problems. First, the programmer should master the fundamentals of the graphics shading languages that require the prior knowledge on computer graphics. Second, in a job which needs much cooperation between CPU and GPU, which is usual in image processings and pattern recognitions contrary to the graphics area, CPU should generate raw feature data for GPU processing as much as possible to effectively utilize GPU performance. This paper proposes more quick and efficient implementation of neural networks on both GPU and multi-core CPU. We use CUDA (compute unified device architecture) that can be easily programmed due to its simple C language-like style instead of GPU to solve the first problem. Moreover, OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is used to concurrently process multiple data with single instruction on multi-core CPU, which results ineffectively utilizing the memories of GPU. In the experiments, we implemented neural networks-based text detection system using the proposed architecture, and the computational times showed about 15 times faster than implementation using CPU and about 4 times faster than implementation on only GPU without OpenMP.}},

    abstract = {{The assumption of the availability of port information at design time of service compositions in Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) is not valid for an increasing number of hosts on the Internet that do not have a public, static IP address. Existing workflow engines do not support services deployed on such hosts, as service invocations require the availability of port information defined either in concrete WSDL definitions or within a deployment descriptor of the BPEL workflow engine. This paper presents a workflow engine that supports runtime look-up of service endpoints based on a P2P middleware. Using a service identifier based on a DHT identifier, Service Proxy objects that encapsulate port information are downloaded over the structured P2P network from the host where the service is deployed. A Service Proxy delegates service invocations to an abstract protocol adaptor framework that uses dynamic invocation mechanisms to provide a protocol-independent execution of remote services, e.g., over GIOP/IIOP or SOAP. This allows us to specify binding- and port-agnostic service compositions in BPEL using abstract WSDL and our service identifiers. To validate our approach, we extended the ActiveBPEL workflow engine to support the discovery and consumption of services using our P2P middleware and the abstract protocol adaptor.}},

Composed of simple interacting agents, this intelligence lies in the networks of interactions among individuals and between individuals and the<br>environment. A fascinating subject, social insects are also a powerful metaphor for artificial intelligence, and the problems they solve--finding food, dividing labor among nestmates, building nests, responding to external challenges--have important counterparts in engineering and computer science. <br> <br>This book provides a detailed look at models of social insect behavior and how to apply these models in the design of complex systems. The book shows how these models replace an emphasis on control, preprogramming, and centralization with designs featuring autonomy, emergence, and distributed<br>functioning. These designs are proving immensely flexible and robust, able to adapt quickly to changing environments and to continue functioning even when individual elements fail. In particular, these designs are an exciting approach to the tremendous growth of complexity in software and<br>information. Swarm Intelligence draws on up-to-date research from biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, operations research, and computer graphics, and each chapter is organized around a particular biological example, which is then used to develop an algorithm, a multiagent<br>system, or a group of robots.

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs). Without a common framework to organize findings, isolated knowledge does not cumulate. Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.}},

We are especially concerned about the cases where the size of the design of experiments is relatively small to the algebraic dimension of the inputs. We first fix the notations and recall some basic properties of Kriging. Then we expose two experimental studies on subjects that are often skipped in the field of computer simulation analysis: the lack of reliability of likelihood maximization with few data and the consequences of a trend misspecification. We finally propose an example from a porous media application, with the introduction of an original Kriging method in which a non-linear additive model is used as an external trend.

    abstract = {{Kriging is a popular analysis approach for computer experiments for the purpose of creating a cheap-to-compute "meta-model" as a surrogate to a computationally expensive engineering simulation model. The maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the parameters in the kriging model. However, the likelihood function near the optimum may be flat in some situations, which leads to maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters in the covariance matrix that have very large variance. To overcome this difficulty, a penalized likelihood approach is proposed for the kriging model. Both theoretical analysis and empirical experience using real world data suggest that the proposed method is particularly important in the context of a computationally intensive simulation model where the number of simulation runs must be kept small because collection of a large sample set is prohibitive. The proposed approach is applied to the reduction of piston slap, an unwanted engine noise due to piston secondary motion. Issues related to practical implementation of the proposed approach are discussed.}},

Unfortunately, the last comprehensive empirical evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes, memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees, and boosted stumps. We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.}},

    abstract = {{We extend Q-learning to a noncooperative multiagent context, using the framework of general-sum stochastic games. A learning agent maintains Q-functions over joint actions, and performs updates based on assuming Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. This learning protocol provably converges given certain restrictions on the stage games (defined by Q-values) that arise during learning. Experiments with a pair of two-player grid games suggest that such restrictions on the game structure are not necessarily required. Stage games encountered during learning in both grid environments violate the conditions. However, learning consistently converges in the first grid game, which has a unique equilibrium Q-function, but sometimes fails to converge in the second, which has three different equilibrium Q-functions. In a comparison of offline learning performance in both games, we find agents are more likely to reach a joint optimal path with Nash Q-learning than with a single-agent Q-learning method. When at least one agent adopts Nash Q-learning, the performance of both agents is better than using single-agent Q-learning. We have also implemented an online version of Nash Q-learning that balances exploration with exploitation, yielding improved performance.}},

@article{citeulike:5839832,
    abstract = {{We consider the problem of designing (perhaps massively distributed) collectives of computational processes to maximize a provided "world utility" function. We consider this problem when the behavior of each process in the collective can be cast as striving to maximize its own payoff utility function. For such cases the central design issue is how to initialize/update those payoff utility functions of the individual processes so as to induce behavior of the entire collective having good values of the world utility. Traditional "team game" approaches to this problem simply assign to each process the world utility as its payoff utility function. In previous work we used the "Collective Intelligence" (COIN) framework to derive a better choice of payoff utility functions, one that results in world utility performance up to orders of magnitude superior to that ensuing from the use of the team game utility. In this paper, we extend these results using a novel mathematical framework. Under that new framework we review the derivation of the general class of payoff utility functions that both (i) are easy for the individual processes to try to maximize, and (ii) have the property that if good values of them are achieved, then we are assured a high value of world utility. These are the "Aristocrat Utility" and a new variant of the "Wonderful Life Utility" that was introduced in the previous COIN work. We demonstrate experimentally that using these new utility functions can result in significantly improved performance over that of previously investigated COIN payoff utilities, over and above those previous utilities' superiority to the conventional team game utility. These results also illustrate the substantial superiority of these payoff functions to perhaps the most natural version of the economics technique of "endogenizing externalities."}},

In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations.

    abstract = {{During metamodel-based optimization three types of implicit errors are typically made. The first error is the simulation-model error, which is defined by the difference between reality and the computer model. The second error is the metamodel error, which is defined by the difference between the computer model and the metamodel. The third is the implementation error. This paper presents new ideas on how to cope with these errors during optimization, in such a way that the final solution is robust with respect to these errors. We apply the robust counterpart theory of Ben-Tal and Nemirovsky to the most frequently used metamodels: linear regression and Kriging models. The methods proposed are applied to the design of two parts of the TV tube. The simulation-model errors receive little attention in the literature, while in practice these errors may have a significant impact due to propagation of such errors.}},

On this study we analyze the arrivals of international tourism (edges) over 206 countries and territories (nodes) around the world, on the year 2004. Using tools from network theory we characterize the topology and weighted properties of the resulting network. International tourist arrivals are analyzed over in strength and out strength flows, resulting on a highly directed and heterogenetic network. Remarkably the random network of connectivity is converted into a power-law network of intensities. It is also shown how strategic positioning particularly benefit from market diversity and that interactions among countries prevail on a technological and economic pattern, questioning the backbones of traveling driving forces. The network structure may influence how tourism hubs, distribution of flows, and centralization can be explored on strategic positioning.}},

Yet, most network measures do not take weights into consideration, and thus do not fully capture the richness of the information contained in the data. In this paper, we focus on a measure originally defined for unweighted networks: the global clustering coefficient. We propose a generalization of this coefficient that retains the information encoded in the weights of ties. We then undertake a comparative assessment by applying the standard and generalized coefficients to a number of network datasets.}},

    abstract = {{The first practical look at spatial statistics for the scientist and engineer.
Designed for the scientific and engineering professional eager to exploit its
enormous potential, Statistics for Spatial Data is a primer to the theory as
well as the nuts-and-bolts of this influential technique. Focusing on the
three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book
sheds light on the link between data and model, and reveals how spatial
statistical models can be used to solve a host of problems in science and
engineering. Revised to reflect state-of-the-art developments, this edition
also features many detailed examples, numerous illustrations, and over 1,000
references. The first fully comprehensive introduction, Statistics for Spatial
Data is an essential guide for professionals in biology, earth science, civil,
electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and
ecology. "This excellent book, which presents the most important branches of
modern spatial statistics in an exemplary manner, will become a basic
reference book and will popularize many methods which have been used until now
only by small circles of specialists." -Mathematical Reviews "The majority of
geoscientists should make sure they have access to this volume, while for
those who are actively involved in applying statistical methods to data (of
all sorts) this book should be in their personal libraries. As a compendium of
statistical procedures to use to analyze data, this volume will surely provide
a good solid framework for some time to come." -Geophysics}},

    abstract = {{Computer experiments often are performed to allow modeling of a response surface of a physical experiment that can be too costly or difficult to run except by using a simulator. Running the experiment over a dense grid can be prohibitively expensive, yet running over a sparse design chosen in advance can result in insufficient information in parts of the space, particularly when the surface calls for a nonstationary model. We propose an approach that automatically explores the space while simultaneously fitting the response surface, using predictive uncertainty to guide subsequent experimental runs. We use the newly developed Bayesian treed Gaussian process as the surrogate model; a fully Bayesian approach allows explicit measures of uncertainty. We develop an adaptive sequential design framework to cope with an asynchronous, random, agent–based supercomputing environment by using a hybrid approach that melds optimal strategies from the statistics literature with flexible strategies from the active learning literature. The merits of this approach are borne out in several examples, including the motivating computational fluid dynamics simulation of a rocket booster.}},

@article{citeulike:5719017,
    abstract = {This article is concerned with prediction of a function y(t) over a (multidimensional) domain T, given the function values at a set of "sites" {t<sup>(1)</sup>, t<sup>(2)</sup>, ..., t<sup>(n)</sup>} in T, and with the design, that is, with the selection of those sites. The motivating application is the design and analysis of computer experiments, where t determines the input to a computer model of a physical or behavioral system, and y(t) is a response that is part of the output or is calculated from it. Following a Bayesian formulation, prior uncertainty about the function y is expressed by means of a random function Y, which is taken here to be a Gaussian stochastic process. The mean of the posterior process can be used as the prediction function ŷ(t), and the variance can be used as a measure of uncertainty. This kind of approach has been used previously in Bayesian interpolation and is strongly related to the kriging methods used in geostatistics. Here emphasis is placed on product linear and product cubic correlation functions, which yield prediction functions that are, respectively, linear or cubic splines in every dimension. A posterior entropy criterion is adopted for design; this minimizes the expected uncertainty about the posterior process, as measured by the entropy. A computational algorithm for finding entropy-optimal designs on multidimensional grids is described. Several examples are presented, including a two-dimensional experiment on a computer model of a thermal energy storage device and a six-dimensional experiment on an integrated circuit simulator. Predictions are made using several different families of correlation functions, with parameters chosen to maximize the likelihood. For comparison, predictions are also made via least squares fitting of various polynomial and spline models. The Bayesian design/prediction methods, which do not require any modeling of y, produce comparatively good predictions. For some correlation functions, however, the 95\% posterior probability intervals do not give adequate coverage of the true values of y at selected test sites. These methods are fairly simple and offer considerable potential for virtually automatic implementation, although further development is needed before they can be applied routinely in practice.},

    abstract = {{Among the many uses of hierarchical modeling, their application to the
statistical analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data from areas such as
epidemiology And environmental science has proven particularly fruitful. Yet
to date, the few books that address the subject have been either too narrowly
focused on specific aspects of spatial analysis, or written at a level often
inaccessible to those lacking a strong background in mathematical
statistics.Hierarchical Modeling and Analysis for Spatial Data is the first
accessible, self-contained treatment of hierarchical methods, modeling, and
data analysis for spatial and spatio-temporal data. Starting with overviews of
the types of spatial data, the data analysis tools appropriate for each, and a
brief review of the Bayesian approach to statistics, the authors discuss
hierarchical modeling for univariate spatial response data, including Bayesian
kriging and lattice (areal data) modeling. They then consider the problem of
spatially misaligned data, methods for handling multivariate spatial
responses, spatio-temporal models, and spatial survival models. The final
chapter explores a variety of special topics, including spatially varying
coefficient models.This book provides clear explanations, plentiful
illustrations --some in full color--a variety of homework problems, and
tutorials and worked examples using some of the field's most popular software
packages.. Written by a team of leaders in the field, it will undoubtedly
remain the primary textbook and reference on the subject for years to come.}},

several drawbacks of the original spring layout. This new algorithm relies on
the balancing of two antagonistic forces. We thus call it {\em arf} for

This setting is especially useful for online learning in sparse feature spaces such as text categorization applications. We demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of our algorithms in numerous batch and online learning tasks. We show that variants of stochastic gradient projection methods augmented with our efficient projection procedures outperform interior point methods, which are considered state-of-the-art optimization techniques.

for new control system application domains, and as a research area it has
experienced a considerable increase in activity in recent years. This volume,
the result of a UCLA collaborative project with Caltech, Cornell and MIT,
presents cutting edge results in terms of the  ” dimensions” of cooperative
control from leading researchers worldwide. This dimensional decomposition
allows the reader to assess the multi-faceted landscape of cooperative
control.

Cooperative Control of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems is organized into four
main themes, or dimensions, of cooperative control: distributed control and
computation, adversarial interactions, uncertain evolution and complexity
management. The military application of autonomous vehicles systems or
multiple unmanned vehicles is primarily targeted; however much of the material
is relevant to a broader range of multi-agent systems including cooperative
robotics, distributed computing, sensor networks and data network congestion
control.

Cooperative Control of Distributed Multi-Agent Systems offers the reader an
organized presentation of a variety of recent research advances, supporting
software and experimental data on the resolution of the cooperative control
problem. It will appeal to senior academics, researchers and graduate students
as well as engineers working in the areas of cooperative systems, control and

    abstract = {{QoS-based Web Service (WS) discovery has been recognized as the main solution for filtering and selecting between functionally equivalent WSs stored in registries or other types of repositories. There are two main techniques for QoS-based WS matchmaking (filtering): ontology-based and Constraint Programming (CP)-based. Unfortunately, the first technique is not efficient as it is based on the rather immature technology of ontology reasoning, while the second one is not accurate as it is based on syntactic QoS-based descriptions and faulty matchmaking metrics. In our previous work, we have developed an extensible and rich ontology language for QoS-based WS description. Moreover, we have devised a semantic alignment algorithm for aligning QoS-based WS descriptions so as to increase the accuracy of QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms. Finally, we have developed two alternative CP-based QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms: a unary-constrained and n-ary-constrained one. In this paper, we claim that Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) should be used as a matchmaking technique instead of CP and we provide experimental results proving it. In addition, we analyze and experimentally evaluate our matchmaking algorithms against a competing techniques one in order to demonstrate their efficiency and accuracy.}},

    abstract = {{The proliferation of open Internet-scale service-oriented platforms based on standards, such as WSDL, SOAP and BPEL, enables the composition of independent Web services into new value-added services. Such service compositions define the information flows between autonomous and potentially heterogeneous services across the boundaries of independent provider organisations. The availability of individual services in such digital ecosystems is likely to be variable due to fluctuating usage load and resource limitations imposed by a service provider's infrastructure. This problem becomes more acute as the number of services in a composition increases. This paper presents a mediation model for improving the availability of composed services. The mediation model masks failures in a service composition by transparently selecting (and executing) an alternative composition at runtime. Service consumers use a common interface to a set of functionally equivalent service compositions while a selection mechanism identifies the most suitable (alternative) service composition. An evaluation of our implementation of the proposed mediation model demonstrates that the consumer perceived availability of value-added services can be improved significantly.}},

    abstract = {{This paper introduces the Multiagent Protocols (MAP) Web service choreography language and demonstrates how service choreographies can be specified, verified, and enacted with a comparatively simple process language. MAP is a directly executable specification, services do not have to be preconfigured at design-time. Instead, a choreography, specified in MAP, can be sent dynamically to a group of distributed peers to execute at runtime. Furthermore, MAP is based on a formal foundation, this allows model checking of the choreography definition prior to live distribution and enactment. A motivating scenario, taken from the AstroGrid science use-cases, serves as the focal point for the paper and highlights the benefits of choreography, through data flow optimization and lack of centralized server. The MAP formal syntax and model checking environment are discussed in the context of the motivating scenario, along with MagentA, an implementation of MAP which provides a concrete, and open-source framework for the enactment of distributed choreographies. MAP is evaluated by demonstrating the languages conformance to the Service Interaction Patterns, a collection of 13 recurring workflow patterns.}},

Servers execute tasks and may differ in their capabilities, e.g. one server may take more time than the other in executing the same task. Mediators act on behalf of users, which can potentially be other mediators, and are responsible for receiving tasks from users and allocating them to servers.This work introduces a new gradient ascent learning algorithm that outperforms state of the art multiagent learners on this problem. We experimentally show that our algorithm converges faster and is less sensitive to tuning parameters than other algorithms. We also provide an informal proof that WPL has the same convergence guarantee as the best known algorithm, GIGA-WoLF. We also show that our algorithm converges in Jordan's and Shapley's games where many other algorithms fail to converge. Finally, we verify the practicality of our algorithm in the distributed task allocation domain, comparing its performance to an optimal global solution.}},

@article{citeulike:5009672,
    abstract = {{We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning for control problems which combines value-function approximation with linear architectures and approximate policy iteration. This new approach is motivated by the least-squares temporal-difference learning algorithm (LSTD) for prediction problems, which is known for its efficient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal-difference algorithms. Heretofore, LSTD has not had a straightforward application to control problems mainly because LSTD learns the state value function of a fixed policy which cannot be used for action selection and control without a model of the underlying process. Our new algorithm, least-squares policy iteration (LSPI), learns the state-action value function which allows for action selection without a model and for incremental policy improvement within a policy-iteration framework. LSPI is a model-free, off-policy method which can use efficiently (and reuse in each iteration) sample experiences collected in any manner. By separating the sample collection method, the choice of the linear approximation architecture, and the solution method, LSPI allows for focused attention on the distinct elements that contribute to practical reinforcement learning. LSPI is tested on the simple task of balancing an inverted pendulum and the harder task of balancing and riding a bicycle to a target location. In both cases, LSPI learns to control the pendulum or the bicycle by merely observing a relatively small number of trials where actions are selected randomly. LSPI is also compared against  Q -learning (both with and without experience replay) using the same value function architecture. While LSPI achieves good performance fairly consistently on the difficult bicycle task,  Q -learning variants were rarely able to balance for more than a small fraction of the time needed to reach the target location.}},

To muddle the waters, competitive systems can show apparent cooperative behavior, and vice versa.

The feedback an agent experiences in a MAS, is usually influenced by the other agents present in the system. Multi agent environments are therefore non-stationary and convergence and optimality guarantees of RL algorithms are lost. To better understand the dynamics of traditional RL algorithms we analyze the learning process in terms of evolutionary dynamics. More specifically we show how the Replicator Dynamics (RD) can be used as a model for Q-learning in games. The dynamical equations of Q-learning are derived and illustrated by some well chosen experiments.

    abstract = {{Many interesting problems in reinforcement learning (RL) are continuous and/or high dimensional, and in this instance, RL techniques require the use of function approximators for learning value functions and policies. Often, local linear models have been preferred over distributed nonlinear models for function approximation in RL. We suggest that one reason for the difficulties encountered when using distributed architectures in RL is the problem of negative interference, whereby learning of new data disrupts previously learned mappings. The continuous temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm <i>TD</i>(lambda) was used to learn a value function in a limited-torque pendulum swing-up task using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Three different approaches were examined for learning in the MLP networks; 1) simple gradient descent; 2) vario-eta; and 3) a <i>pseudopattern</i> rehearsal strategy that attempts to reduce the effects of interference. Our results show that MLP networks can be used for value function approximation in this task but require long training times. We also found that vario-eta destabilized learning and resulted in a failure of the learning process to converge. Finally, we showed that the <i>pseudopattern</i> rehearsal strategy drastically improved the speed of learning. The results indicate that interference is a greater problem than ill conditioning for this task.}},

@article{citeulike:4971407,
    abstract = {{Originally, learning automata (LAs) were introduced to describe human behavior from both a biological and psychological point of view. In this paper, we show that a set of interconnected LAs is also able to describe the behavior of an ant colony, capable of finding the shortest path from their nest to food sources and back. The field of ant colony optimization (ACO) models ant colony behavior using artificial ant algorithms. These algorithms find applications in a whole range of optimization problems and have been experimentally proved to work very well. It turns out that a known model of interconnected LA, used to control Markovian decision problems (MDPs) in a decentralized fashion, matches perfectly with these ant algorithms. The field of LAs can thus both impart in the understanding of why ant algorithms work so well and may also become an important theoretical tool for learning in multiagent systems (MAS) in general. To illustrate this, we give an example of how LAs can be used directly in common Markov game problems.}},

In recent work, online RL yielded effective server allocation policies in a prototype Data Center, without explicit system models or built-in domain knowledge. This paper presents a substantially improved and more practical  ” hybrid” approach, in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing-theoretic policy controls the system. This approach avoids potentially poor performance in live online training. Additionally we use nonlinear function approximators instead of tabular value functions; this greatly improves scalability, and surprisingly, eliminated the need for exploratory actions. In experiments using both open-loop and closed-loop traffic as well as large switching delays, our results show significant performance improvement over state-of-art queuing model policies.}},

In most real-world reinforcement learning tasks, TD methods require a function approximator to represent the value function. However, using function approximators requires manually making crucial representational decisions. This paper investigates evolutionary function approximation, a novel approach to automatically selecting function approximator representations that enable efficient individual learning. This method evolves individuals that are better able to learn. We present a fully implemented instantiation of evolutionary function approximation which combines NEAT, a neuroevolutionary optimization technique, with Q-learning, a popular TD method. The resulting NEAT+Q algorithm automatically discovers effective representations for neural network function approximators. This paper also presents on-line evolutionary computation, which improves the on-line performance of evolutionary computation by borrowing selection mechanisms used in TD methods to choose individual actions and using them in evolutionary computation to select policies for evaluation. We evaluate these contributions with extended empirical studies in two domains: 1) the mountain car task, a standard reinforcement learning benchmark on which neural network function approximators have previously performed poorly and 2) server job scheduling, a large probabilistic domain drawn from the field of autonomic computing. The results demonstrate that evolutionary function approximation can significantly improve the performance of TD methods and on-line evolutionary computation can significantly improve evolutionary methods. This paper also presents additional tests that offer insight into what factors can make neural network function approximation difficult in practice.}},

    abstract = {{By using other agents' experiences and knowledge, a learning agent may learn faster, make fewer mistakes, and create some rules for unseen situations. These benefits would be gained if the learning agent can extract proper rules from the other agents' knowledge for its own requirements. One possible way to do this is to have the learner assign some expertness values (intelligence level values) to the other agents and use their knowledge accordingly. Some criteria to measure the expertness of the reinforcement learning agents are introduced. Also, a new cooperative learning method, called weighted strategy sharing (WSS) is presented. In this method, each agent measures the expertness of its teammates and assigns a weight to their knowledge and learns from them accordingly. The presented methods are tested on two Hunter-Prey systems. We consider that the agents are all learning from each other and compare them with those who cooperate only with the more expert ones. Also, the effect of communication noise, as a source of uncertainty, on the cooperative learning method is studied. Moreover, the Q-table of one of the cooperative agents is changed randomly and its effects on the presented methods are examined}},

    abstract = {{Metamodels are widely used to facilitate the analysis and optimization of engineering systems that involve computationally expensive simulations. Kriging is a metamodelling technique that is well known for its ability to build surrogate models of responses with non-linear behaviour. However, the assumption of a stationary covariance structure underlying Kriging does not hold in situations where the level of smoothness of a response varies significantly. Although non-stationary Gaussian process models have been studied for years in statistics and geostatistics communities, this has largely been for physical experimental data in relatively low dimensions. In this paper, the non-stationary covariance structure is incorporated into Kriging modelling for computer simulations. To represent the non-stationary covariance structure, we adopt a non-linear mapping approach based on parameterized density functions. To avoid over-parameterizing for the high dimension problems typical of engineering design, we propose a modified version of the non-linear map approach, with a sparser, yet flexible, parameterization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both mathematical and engineering examples. The robustness of the method is verified by testing multiple functions under various sampling settings. We also demonstrate that our method is effective in quantifying prediction uncertainty associated with the use of metamodels. Copyright {\copyright} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. We cast this challenge as an information flow problem in a social network. This paper presents social network analysis metrics that may be used to support a novel and practical forwarding solution to provide efficient message delivery in disconnected delay-tolerant MANETs. These metrics are based on social analysis of a node's past interactions and consists of three locally evaluated components: a node's "betweenness" centrality (calculated using ego networks) and a node's social 'similarity' to the destination node and a node's tie strength relationship with the destination node. We present simulations using three real trace data sets to demonstrate that by combining these metrics delivery performance may be achieved close to epidemic routing but with significantly reduced overhead. Additionally, we show improved performance when compared to PRoPHET routing.}},

    abstract = {{Recent studies of cellular networks have revealed modular organizations of genes and proteins. For example, in interactome networks, a module refers to a group of interacting proteins that form molecular complexes and/or biochemical pathways and together mediate a biological process. However, it is still poorly understood how biological information is transmitted between different modules. We have developed information flow analysis, a new computational approach that identifies proteins central to the transmission of biological information throughout the network. In the information flow analysis, we represent an interactome network as an electrical circuit, where interactions are modeled as resistors and proteins as interconnecting junctions. Construing the propagation of biological signals as flow of electrical current, our method calculates an information flow score for every protein. Unlike previous metrics of network centrality such as degree or betweenness that only consider topological features, our approach incorporates confidence scores of protein-protein interactions and automatically considers all possible paths in a network when evaluating the importance of each protein. We apply our method to the interactome networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that the likelihood of observing lethality and pleiotropy when a protein is eliminated is positively correlated with the protein's information flow score. Even among proteins of low degree or low betweenness, high information scores serve as a strong predictor of loss-of-function lethality or pleiotropy. The correlation between information flow scores and phenotypes supports our hypothesis that the proteins of high information flow reside in central positions in interactome networks. We also show that the ranks of information flow scores are more consistent than that of betweenness when a large amount of noisy data is added to an interactome. Finally, we combine gene expression data with interaction data in C. elegans and construct an interactome network for muscle-specific genes. We find that genes that rank high in terms of information flow in the muscle interactome network but not in the entire network tend to play important roles in muscle function. This framework for studying tissue-specific networks by the information flow model can be applied to other tissues and other organisms as well.}},

In this paper, we have studied two kinds of network from software engineering: the component dependence network and the sorting comparison network (SCN). It is found that they both show the same scale-free property under certain conditions as complex networks in other fields. These results suggest that complex-network theory can be a useful approach to the study of software systems. The special properties of SCNs provide a more repeatable and deterministic way to study the evolution and optimization of complex networks. They also suggest that the closer a sorting algorithm is to the theoretical optimal limit, the more its SCN is like a scale-free network. This may also indicate that, to store and retrieve information efficiently, a concept network might need to be scale-free. </para>}},

A generalized version of this technique, called cokriging, can be used for image fusion of remotely sensed data. However, it is computationally very expensive for large data sets. We demonstrate the time efficiency and accuracy of approximating ordinary kriging through the use of fast matrix-vector products combined with iterative methods. We used methods based on the fast Multipole methods and nearest neighbor searching techniques for implementations of the fast matrix-vector products.}},

There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage.</P> <P></P> <P>This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6).

Most traditional methods of interpolation are based on mathematical as distinct from stochastic models of spatial variation. Spatially distributed data behave more like random variables, however, and regionalized variable theory provides a set of stochastic methods for analysing them. Kriging is the method of interpolation deriving from regionalized variable theory. It depends on expressing spatial variation of the property in terms of the variogram, and it minimizes the prediction errors which are themselves estimated. We describe the procedures and the way we link them using standard operating systems. We illustrate them using examples from case studies, one involving the mapping and control of soil salinity in the Jordan Valley of Israel, the other in semi-arid Botswana where the herbaceous cover was estimated and mapped from aerial photographic survey.}},

However, Geographic information systems (GIS) still provide a resource-hungry application domain that can make good use of parallel techniques. We describe our work with geographical systems for environmental and defence applications and some of the algorithms and techniques we have deployed to deliver high-performance prototype systems that can deal with large data sets. GIS applications are often run operationally as part of decision support systems with both a human interactive component as well as large scale batch or server-based components. Parallel computing technology embedded in a distributed system therefore provides an ideal and practical solution for multi-site organisations and especially government agencies who need to extract the best value from bulk geographic data. We describe the distributed computing approaches we have used to integrate bulk data and metadata sources and the grid computing techniques we have used to embed parallel services in an operational infrastructure. We describe some of the parallel techniques we have used: for data assimilation; for image and map data processing; for data cluster analysis; and for data mining. We also discuss issues related to emerging standards for data exchange and design issues for integrating together data in a distributed ownership system. We include a historical review of our work in this area over the last decade which leads us to believe parallel computing will continue to play an important role in GIS. We speculate on algorithmic and systems issues for the future.}},

Techniques from statistical physics have been successfully applied to the analysis of these networks, and have uncovered surprising statistical structural properties that have also been shown to have a major effect on their functionality, dynamics, robustness, and fragility. This paper examines, for the first time, the statistical properties of strategically important organizational networks--networks of people engaged in distributed product development (PD)--and discusses the significance of these properties in providing insight into ways of improving the strategic and operational decision making of the organization. We show that the structure of information flow networks that are at the heart of large-scale product development efforts have properties that are similar to those displayed by other social, biological, and technological networks. In this context, we also identify novel properties that may be characteristic of other information-carrying networks. We further present a detailed model and analysis of PD dynamics on complex networks, and show how the underlying network topologies provide direct information about the characteristics of these dynamics. We believe that our new analysis methodology and empirical results are also relevant to other organizational information-carrying networks. 10.1287/mnsc.1060.0617}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a neural architecture for learning category nodes encoding mappings across multimodal patterns involving sensory inputs, actions, and rewards. By integrating adaptive resonance theory (ART) and temporal difference (TD) methods, the proposed neural model, called TD fusion architecture for learning, cognition, and navigation (TD-FALCON), enables an autonomous agent to adapt and function in a dynamic environment with immediate as well as delayed evaluative feedback (reinforcement) signals. TD-FALCON learns the value functions of the state-action space estimated through on-policy and off-policy TD learning methods, specifically state-action-reward-state-action (SARSA) and Q-learning. The learned value functions are then used to determine the optimal actions based on an action selection policy. We have developed TD-FALCON systems using various TD learning strategies and compared their performance in terms of task completion, learning speed, as well as time and space efficiency. Experiments based on a minefield navigation task have shown that TD-FALCON systems are able to learn effectively with both immediate and delayed reinforcement and achieve a stable performance in a pace much faster than those of standard gradient-descent-based reinforcement learning systems.}},

    abstract = {{Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from slow convergence and even divergence, especially in large-scale systems. In this work, we develop a supervision framework to speed up the convergence of MARL algorithms in a network of agents. The framework defines an organizational structure for automated supervision and a communication protocol for exchanging information between lower-level agents and higher-level supervising agents. The abstracted states of lower-level agents travel upwards so that higher-level supervising agents generate a broader view of the state of the network. This broader view is used in creating supervisory information which is passed down the hierarchy. We present a generic extension to MARL algorithms that integrates supervisory information into the learning process, guiding agents' exploration of their state-action space.}},

    abstract = {{To cope with large scale, agents are usually organized in a network such that an agent interacts only with its immediate neighbors in the network. Reinforcement learning techniques have been commonly used to optimize agents local policies in such a network because they require little domain knowledge and can be fully distributed. However, all of the previous work assumed the underlying network was fixed throughout the learning process. This assumption was important because the underlying network defines the learning context of each agent. In particular, the set of actions and the state space for each agent is defined in terms of the agent's neighbors. If agents dynamically change the underlying network structure (also called self-organize) during learning, then one needs a mechanism for transferring what agents have learned so far before (in the old network structure) to their new learning context (in the new network structure).}},

We study in this paper a class of DEC-MDPs that restricts the interactions between the agents to a structured, event-driven dependency. These dependencies can model locking a shared resource or temporal enabling constraints, both of which arise frequently in practice. The complexity of this class of problems is shown to be no harder than exponential in the number of states and doubly exponential in the number of dependencies. Since the number of dependencies is much smaller than the number of states for many problems, this is significantly better than the doubly exponential (in the state space) complexity of DEC-MDPs. We also demonstrate how an algorithm we previously developed can be used to solve problems in this class both optimally and approximately. Experimental work indicates that this solution technique is significantly faster than a naive policy search approach.}},

    abstract = {{Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.}},

elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part
I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision
processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte

An efficient solution to UTC must be adaptive in order to deal with the highly-dynamic nature of urban traffic. In the near future, global positioning systems and vehicle-to-vehicle/infrastructure communication may provide a more detailed local view of the traffic situation that could be employed for better global UTC optimization. In this paper we describe the design of a next-generation UTC system that exploits such local knowledge about a junction's traffic in order to optimize traffic control. Global UTC optimization is achieved using a local Adaptive Round Robin (ARR) phase switching model optimized using Collaborative Reinforcement Learning (CRL). The design employs an ARR-CRL-based agent controller for each signalized junction that collaborates with neighbouring agents in order to learn appropriate phase timing based on the traffic pattern. We compare our approach to non-adaptive fixed-time UTC system and to a saturation balancing algorithm in a large-scale simulation of traffic in Dublin's inner city centre. We show that the ARR-CRL approach can provide significant improvement resulting in up to \~{}57\&\#x025; lower average waiting time per vehicle compared to the saturation balancing algorithm.}},

    abstract = {{Recently, the piecewise linear representation (PLR) method has been applied to the stock market for pattern matching. As such, similar patterns can be retrieved from historical data and future prices of the stock can be predicted according to the patterns retrieved. In this paper, a different approach is taken by applying PLR to decompose historical data into different segments. As a result, temporary turning points (trough or peak) of the historical stock data can be detected and inputted to the backpropagation neural network (BPN) for supervised training of the model. After this, a new set of test data can trigger the model when a buy or sell point is detected by BPN. An intelligent PLR (IPLR) model is further developed by integrating the genetic algorithm with the PLR to iteratively improve the threshold value of the PLR. Thus, it further increases the profitability of the model. The proposed system is tested on three different types of stocks, i.e., uptrend, steady, and downtrend. The experimental results show that the IPLR approach can make significant amounts of profit on stocks with different variations. In conclusion, the proposed system is very effective and encouraging in that it predicts the future trading points of a specific stock.}},

    abstract = {{Service chaining, the act of stringing a sequence of services together to form a new service, is a key element of Web services. However, for Web services to reach its full potential the issue of testing service-chaining at the network level must be resolved. How can one map the microlevel service-service interactions to the macrolevel system performance? For instance, as service chains become longer and more complex, how do they affect end-user quality of service? Focusing on aggregate service chains \$situations in which the user invokes a service that carries out the chain, without the user being aware of the individual services - we tackle these questions using a Java simulation tool to model service chaining, visualize network traffic and quantify service chain complexity. We demonstrate that one can orchestrate very complex service chains in a simple distributed manner and quantify how service chain complexity affects end-user quality of service and network loading.}},

    abstract = {{We study the topological structure of the network of shareholding relationships in the Italian stock market (MIB) and in two US stock markets (NYSE and NASDAQ). The portfolio diversification and the wealth invested on the market by economical agents have been shown in our previous work to have all a power law behavior. However, a further investigation shows that the inner structure of the capital control network are not at all the same across markets. The shareholding network is a weighted graph, therefore we introduce two quantities analogous to in-degree and out-degree for weighted graphs which measure, respectively: the number of effective shareholders of a stock and the number of companies effectively controlled by a single holder. Combining the information carried by the distributions of these two quantities we are able to extract the backbone of each market and we find that while the MIB splits into several separated groups of interest, the US markets is characterized by very large holders sharing control on overlapping subsets of stocks. This method seems promising for the analysis of the topology of capital control networks in general and not only in the stock market.}},

    abstract = {{We propose a network description of large market investments, where both stocks and shareholders are represented as vertices connected by weighted links corresponding to shareholdings. In this framework, the in-degree (kin) and the sum of incoming link weights (v) of an investor correspond to the number of assets held (portfolio diversification) and to the invested wealth (portfolio volume), respectively. An empirical analysis of three different real markets reveals that the distributions of both kin and v display power-law tails with exponents [gamma] and [alpha]. Moreover, we find that kin scales as a power-law function of v with an exponent [beta]. Remarkably, despite the values of [alpha], [beta] and [gamma] differ across the three markets, they are always governed by the scaling relation [beta]=(1-[alpha])/(1-[gamma]). We show that these empirical findings can be reproduced by a recent model relating the emergence of scale-free networks to an underlying Paretian distribution of `hidden' vertex properties.}},

    abstract = {{Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising new approach to systems performance management that differs radically from standard queuing-theoretic approaches making use of explicit system performance models. In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic model, and with little or no built-in system specific knowledge. In our original work (Das, R., Tesauro, G., Walsh, W.E.: IBM Research, Tech. Rep. RC23802 ( 2005 ), Tesauro, G.: In: Proc. of AAAI-05 , pp. 886–891 ( 2005 ), Tesauro, G., Das, R., Walsh, W.E., Kephart, J.O.: In: Proc. of ICAC-05 , pp. 342–343 ( 2005 )) we showed the feasibility of using online RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which can be used to make high-quality server allocation decisions in a multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a hybrid approach, in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid suffering potentially poor performance in live online training. We also now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that, in both open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The increasing demand for mobility in our society poses various challenges to traffic engineering, computer science in general, and artificial intelligence and multiagent systems in particular. As it is often the case, it is not possible to provide additional capacity, so that a more efficient use of the available transportation infrastructure is necessary. This relates closely to multiagent systems as many problems in traffic management and control are inherently distributed. Also, many actors in a transportation system fit very well the concept of autonomous agents: the driver, the pedestrian, the traffic expert; in some cases, also the intersection and the traffic signal controller can be regarded as an autonomous agent. However, the  ” agentification” of a transportation system is associated with some challenging issues: the number of agents is high, typically agents are highly adaptive, they react to changes in the environment at individual level but cause an unpredictable collective pattern, and act in a highly coupled environment. Therefore, this domain poses many challenges for standard techniques from multiagent systems such as coordination and learning. This paper has two main objectives: (i) to present problems, methods, approaches and practices in traffic engineering (especially regarding traffic signal control); and (ii) to highlight open problems and challenges so that future research in multiagent systems can address them.}},

MASON, Repast, and Swarm are  ” framework and library” platforms, providing a conceptual framework for organizing and designing ABMs and corresponding software libraries. MASON is least mature and designed with execution speed a high priority. The Objective-C version of Swarm is the most mature library platform and is stable and well organized. Objective-C seems more natural than Java for ABMs but weak error-handling and the lack of developer tools are drawbacks. Java Swarm allows Swarm's Objective-C libraries to be called from Java; it does not seem to combine the advantages of the two languages well. Repast provides Swarm-like functions in a Java library and is a good choice for many, but parts of its organization and design could be improved. A rough comparison of execution speed found MASON and Repast usually fastest (MASON 1-35\% faster than Repast), Swarm (including Objective-C) fastest for simple models but slowest for complex ones, and NetLogo intermediate. Recommendations include completing the documentation (for all platforms except NetLogo), strengthening conceptual frameworks, providing better tools for statistical output and automating simulation experiments, simplifying common tasks, and researching technologies for understanding how simulation results arise.}},

    abstract = {{Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest andhave significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-madephenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws iscomplicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of thedistribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events-- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behaviorholds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such asleast-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates ofparameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methodsreturn accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give noindication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present aprincipled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-lawbehavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fittingmethods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statisticand likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with testson synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We alsoapply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range ofdifferent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-lawdistribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with thedata while in others the power law is ruled out.}},

    abstract = {{Probabilistic inference is an attractive approach to uncertain reasoning and empirical learning in artificial intelligence. Computational difficulties arise, however, because probabilistic models with the necessary realism and flexibility lead to complex distributions over high-dimensional spaces. Related problems in other fields have been tackled using Monte Carlo methods based on sampling using Markov chains, providing a rich array of techniques that can be applied to problems in artificial intelligence. The "Metropolis algorithm" has been used to solve difficult problems in statistical physics for over forty years, and, in the last few years, the related method of "Gibbs sampling" has been applied to problems of statistical inference. Concurrently, an alternative method for solving problems in statistical physics by means of dynamical simulation has been developed as well, and has recently been unified with the Metropolis algorithm to produce the "hybrid Monte Carlo" method. In computer science, Markov chain sampling is the basis of the heuristic optimization technique of "simulated annealing", and has recently been used in randomized algorithms for approximate counting of large sets. In this review, I outline the role of probabilistic inference in artificial intelligence, present the theory of Markov chains, and describe various Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, along with a number of supporting techniques. I try to present a comprehensive picture of the range of methods that have been developed, including techniques from the varied literature that have not yet seen wide application in artificial intelligence, but which appear relevant. As illustrative examples, I use the problems of probabilistic inference in expert systems, discovery of latent classes from data, and Bayesian learning for neural networks.}},

a power-law regime followed by a sharp cut-off; (c) single-scale networks,
characterized by a connectivity distribution with a fast decaying tail.
Moreover, we note for the classes of broad-scale and single-scale networks that
there are constraints limiting the addition of new links. Our results suggest
that the nature of such constraints may be the controlling factor for the

To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern.

It is found that by tuning the parameter α, the scale-free network capacity measured by the order parameter is considerably enhanced compared to the normal next-nearest-neighbor strategy. Traffic dynamics both near and far away from the critical generating rate Rc are discussed, and it is found that the behavior of 1/f-like noise of the load time series not only depends on the generating rate R but also on the parameter α. We also investigate Rc as functions of C (capacity of nodes), m (connectivity density) and N (network size). Due to the low cost of acquiring next-nearest-neighbor information and the strongly improved network capacity, our strategy may be useful for the protocol designing of modern communication networks.}},

In this paper we address this question by using numerical models in which both structure and dynamics are controlled systematically. We consider the traffic of information packets that include driving, searching and queuing. We present the results of extensive simulations on two classes of networks; a correlated cyclic scale-free network and an uncorrelated homogeneous weakly clustered network. By measuring different dynamical variables in the free flow regime we show how the global statistical properties of the transport are related to the temporal fluctuations at individual nodes (the traffic noise) and the links (the traffic flow). We then demonstrate that these two network classes appear as representative topologies for optimal traffic flow in the regimes of low density and high density traffic, respectively. We also determine statistical indicators of the pre-jamming regime on different network geometries and discuss the role of queuing and dynamical betweenness for the traffic congestion. The transition to the jammed traffic regime at a critical posting rate on different network topologies is studied as a phase transition with an appropriate order parameter. We also address several open theoretical problems related to the network dynamics.}},

Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, and the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by physical links. While traditionally these systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks, and the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.}},

    abstract = {{Message delivery in sparse Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) is difficult due to the fact that the network graph is rarely (if ever) connected. A key challenge is to find a route that can provide good delivery performance and low end-to-end delay in a disconnected network graph where nodes may move freely. This paper presents a multidisciplinary solution based on the consideration of the so-called small world dynamics which have been proposed for economy and social studies and have recently revealed to be a successful approach to be exploited for characterising information propagation in wireless networks. To this purpose, some bridge nodes are identified based on their centrality characteristics, i.e., on their capability to broker information exchange among otherwise disconnected nodes. Due to the complexity of the centrality metrics in populated networks the concept of ego networks is exploited where nodes are not required to exchange information about the entire network topology, but only locally available information is considered. Then SimBet Routing is proposed which exploits the exchange of pre-estimated "betweenness' centrality metrics and locally determined social "similarity' to the destination node. We present simulations using real trace data to demonstrate that SimBet Routing results in delivery performance close to Epidemic Routing but with significantly reduced overhead. Additionally, we show that SimBet Routing outperforms PRoPHET Routing, particularly when the sending and receiving nodes have low connectivity.}},

    abstract = {{This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning elds. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and arti cial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal tra c distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority.}},

    abstract = {{Swarm intelligence is widely recognized as a powerful paradigm of
self-organized optimization, with numerous examples of successful applications
in distributed artificial intelligence. However, the role of physical
interactions in the organization of traffic flows in ants under crowded
conditions has only been studied very recently. The related results suggest new
ways of congestion control and simple algorithms for optimal resource usage
based on local interactions and, therefore, decentralized control concepts.
Here, we present a mathematical analysis of such a concept for an experiment
with two alternative ways with limited capacities between a food source and the
nest of an ant colony. Moreover, we carry out microscopic computer simulations
for generalized setups, in which ants have more alternatives or the alternative
ways are of different lengths. In this way and by variation of interaction
parameters, we can get a better idea, how powerful congestion control based on
local repulsive interactions may be. Finally, we will discuss potential
applications of this design principle to routing in traffic or data networks
and machine usage in supply systems.}},

@book{citeulike:3734647,
    abstract = {{This text serves as a cookbook for neural network solutions to practical
problems using C++. It will enable those with moderate programming experience
to select a neural network model appropriate to solving a particular problem,
and to produce a working program implementing that network. The book provides
guidance along the entire problem-solving path, including designing the
training set, preprocessing variables, training and validating the network,
and evaluating its performance. Though the book is not intended as a general
course in neural networks, no background in neural works is assumed and all
models are presented from the ground up.

The principle focus of the book is the three layer feedforward network, for
more than a decade as the workhorse of professional arsenals. Other network
models with strong performance records are also included.

Bound in the book is an IBM diskette that includes the source code for all
programs in the book. Much of this code can be easily adapted to C compilers.
In addition, the operation of all programs is thoroughly discussed both in the
text and in the comments within the code to facilitate translation to other
languages.}},

Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written so that even their own authors would be mystified, if they bothered to read their own writing. For this reason, an understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-two illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.}},

In a simple nonparametric regression problem, where such a function gives the mean of a Gaussian distribution for an observed response, a Gaussian process model can easily be implemented using matrix computations that are feasible for datasets of up to about a thousand cases. Hyperparameters that define the covariance function of the Gaussian process can be sampled using Markov chain methods. Regression models where the noise has a t distribution and logistic or probit models for classification applications can be implemented by sampling as well for latent values underlying the observations. Software is now available that implements these methods using covariance functions with hierarchical parameterizations. Models defined in this way can discover high-level properties of the data, such as which inputs are relevant to predicting the response.}},

This insight is never more important than when a new facility is designed and built. In this study of a particular company in the specialty chemicals industry, a general simulation metamodel was developed in order to understand better how plant design parameters could be optimized in order to maximize plant throughput under certain environmental conditions and with certain asset investment constraints. The simulation metamodel developed is essentially a deterministic, analytical representation of a detailed, discrete-event, stochastic simulation model that was previously developed and validated to study operational and scheduling issues. The development of the simulation metamodel for plant design, as a function of capacity and throughput, is described in this paper. This study exemplifies the application of detailed, discrete-event, stochastic simulation models to derive deterministic, analytical response surface representations for purposes of plant design and throughput analysis in the process industries.}},

The framework is especially intended for simulation models where the calculation of the corresponding stochastic response function is very expensive or time-consuming. Response Surface Methodology is frequently used for the optimization of stochastic simulation models in a non-automated fashion. In scientific applications there is a clear need for a standardized algorithm based on Response Surface Methodology. In addition, an automated algorithm is less time-consuming, since there is no need to interfere in the optimization process. In our framework for automated optimization we describe the many choices that have to be made in constructing such an algorithm}},

    abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method to select an experimental design for interpolation in random simulation, especially discrete event simulation. (Though the paper focuses on Kriging, this design approach may also apply to other types of metamodels such as non-linear regression models and splines.) Assuming that simulation requires much computer time, it is important to select a design with a small number of observations (or simulation runs). The proposed method is therefore sequential. Its novelty is that it accounts for the specific input/output behavior (or response function) of the particular simulation at hand; i.e., the method is customized or application-driven. A tool for this customization is bootstrapping, which enables the estimation of the variances of predictions for inputs not yet simulated. The method is tested through two classic simulation models, namely the expected steady-state waiting time of the M/M/1 queuing model, and the mean costs of a terminating (s, S) inventory simulation. For these two simulation models the novel design indeed gives better results than a popular alternative design, namely Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) with a prefixed sample.}},

Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) proposed the potential-based shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior. In this note, we prove certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specically, we prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping algorithm 's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler method for capturing the algorithm's benet. In addition, the equivalence raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the eciency of learning with potential-based shaping. 1. Potential-Based Shaping}},

Reinforcement learning is a generic method that suits the needs of MA learning in many aspects. This paper presents two new multiagent based domain independent coordination mechanisms for reinforcement learning; multiple agents do not require explicit communication among themselves to learn coordinated behavior. The first coordination mechanism is the perceptual coordination mechanism, where other agents are included in state descriptions and coordination information is learned from state transitions. The second is the observing coordination mechanism, which also includes other agents in state descriptions and additionally the rewards of nearby agents are observed from the environment. The observed rewards and agent's own reward are used to construct an optimal policy. This way, the latter mechanism tends to increase region-wide joint rewards. The selected experimented domain is adversarial food-collecting world (AFCW), which can be configured both as single and multiagent environments. Function approximation and generalization techniques are used because of the huge state space. Experimental results show the effectiveness of these mechanisms}},

Their states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to changing passenger arrival rates. In addition, we use a team of RL agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car. The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of the state.

Pure exploitation causes the agent to reach the locally optimal policies quickly, whereas excessive exploration degrades the performance of the Q-learning algorithm even if it may accelerate the learning process and allow avoiding the locally optimal policies. In this paper, finding the optimum policy in Q-learning is described as search for the optimum solution in combinatorial optimization. The Metropolis criterion of simulated annealing algorithm is introduced in order to balance exploration and exploitation of Q-learning, and the modified Q-learning algorithm based on this criterion, SA-Q-learning, is presented.

@book{citeulike:3085571,
    abstract = {{Since the publication of the first edition in 1982, the goal of Simulation
Modeling and Analysis has always been to provide a comprehensive, state-of-
the-art, and technically correct treatment of all important aspects of a
simulation study. The book strives to make this material understandable by the
use of intuition and numerous figures, examples, and problems. It is equally
well suited for use in university courses, simulation practice, and self
study. The book is widely regarded as the  ” bible” of simulation and now has
more than 100,000 copies in print. The book can serve as the primary text for
a variety of courses; for example:

• A first course in simulation at the junior, senior, or beginning-graduate-
student level in engineering, manufacturing, business, or computer science
(Chaps. 1 through 4, and parts of Chaps. 5 through 9). At the end of such a
course, the students will be prepared to carry out complete and effective
simulation studies, and to take advanced simulation courses.

• A second course in simulation for graduate students in any of the above
disciplines (most of Chaps. 5 through 12). After completing this course, the
student should be familiar with the more advanced methodological issues
involved in a simulation study, and should be prepared to understand and
conduct simulation research.

• An introduction to simulation as part of a general course in operations
research or management science (part of Chaps. 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9).}},

networks to be connected to other vertices that are like (or unlike) them in
some way. We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as
language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As
a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree,
i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices:
do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose
a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing
types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that
assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also
propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones
based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo
graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of
networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of
mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the
connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal
of vertices.}},

More precisely, in a lattice network augmented by extra random edges (but not chosen uniformly), a short path of polylogarithmic expected length can be found using a greedy algorithm with a local knowledge of the nodes.

Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using any one of a number of possible  ” betweenness” measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.}},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.}},

@book{citeulike:562645,
    abstract = {{This exceptionally useful text offers Scott Myers's expertise in C++ class design and programming tips. The second edition incorporates recent advances to C++ included in the ISO standard, including namespaces and built-in template classes, and is required reading for any working C++ developer.<p> The book opens with some hints for porting code from C to C++ and then moves on to the proper use of the <I>new</I> and <I>delete</I> operators in C++ for more robust memory management. The text then proceeds to class design, including the proper use of constructors, destructors, and overloaded operator functions for assignment within classes. (These guidelines ensure that you will create custom C++ classes that are fully functional data types, which can be copied and assigned just like built-in C++ classes.)<p> The author also provides a handful of suggestions for general class design, including strategies for using different types of inheritance and encapsulation. Never doctrinaire and always intelligent, these guidelines can make your C++ classes more robust and easier to maintain. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> I wrote the original edition of Effective C++ in 1991. When the time came for a second edition in 1997, I updated the material in important ways, but, because I didn't want to confuse readers familiar with the first edition, I did my best to retain the existing structure: 48 of the original 50 Item titles remained essentially unchanged. If the book were a house, the second edition was the equivalent of freshening things up by replacing carpets, paint, and light fixtures. For the third edition, I tore the place down to the studs. (There were times I wished I'd gone all the way to the foundation.) The world of C++ has undergone enormous change since 1991, and the goal of this book -; to identify the most important C++ programming guidelines in a small, readable package -; was no longer served by the Items I'd established nearly 15 years earlier. In 1991, it was reasonable to assume that C++ programmers came from a C background. Now, programmers moving to C++ are just as likely to come from Java or C\#. In 1991, inheritance and object-oriented programming were new to most programmers. Now they're well-established concepts, and exceptions, templates, and generic programming are the areas where people need more guidance. In 1991, nobody had heard of design patterns. Now it's hard to discuss software systems without referring to them. In 1991, work had just begun on a formal standard for C++. Now that standard is eight years old, and work has begun on the next version. To address these changes, I wiped the slate as clean as I could and asked myself, What are the most important pieces of advice for practicing C++ programmers in 2005? The result is the set of Items in this new edition. The book has new chapters on resource management and on programming with templates. In fact, template concerns are woven throughout the text, because they affect almost everything in C++. The book also includes new material on programming in the presence of exceptions, on applying design patterns, and on using the new TR1 library facilities. (TR1 is described in Item54.) It acknowledges that techniques and approaches that work well in single-threaded systems may not be appropriate in multithreaded systems. Well over half the material in the book is new. However, most of the fundamental information in the second edition continues to be important, so I found a way to retain it in one form or another. (You'll find a mapping between the second and third edition Items in Appendix B.) I've worked hard to make this book as good as I can, but I have no illusions that it's perfect. If you feel that some of the Items in this book are inappropriate as general advice; that there is a better way to accomplish a task examined in the book; or that one or more of the technical discussions is unclear, incomplete, or misleading, please tell me. If you find an error of any kind -; technical, grammatical, typographical, whatever -; please tell me that, too. I'll gladly add to the acknowledgments in later printings the name of the first person to bring each problem to my attention. Even with the number of Items expanded to 55, the set of guidelines in this book is far from exhaustive. But coming up with good rules -; ones that apply to almost all applications almost all the time -; is harder than it might seem. If you have suggestions for additional guidelines, I would be delighted to hear about them. I maintain a list of changes to this book since its first printing, including bug fixes, clarifications, and technical updates. The list is available at the Effective C++ Errata web page, [a href="http://aristeia.com/BookErrata/ec++3e-errata.html"}},

the terminal value of a cumulative gains process. The problem of modelling and
pricing such an asset and associated derivatives is important, for example, in
the determination of optimal insurance claims reserve policies, and in the
pricing of reinsurance contracts. In the insurance setting, the aggregate
claims play the role of the cumulative gains, and the terminal cash flow
represents the totality of the claims payable for the given accounting period.
A similar example arises when we consider the accumulation of losses in a
credit portfolio, and value a contract that pays an amount equal to the
totality of the losses over a given time interval. An explicit expression for
the value process is obtained. The price of an Arrow-Debreu security on the
cumulative gains process is determined, and is used to obtain a closed-form
expression for the price of a European-style option on the value of the asset.
The results obtained make use of various remarkable properties of the gamma
bridge process, and are applicable to a wide variety of financial products
based on cumulative gains processes such as aggregate claims, credit portfolio
losses, defined-benefit pension schemes, emissions, and rainfall.}},

    abstract = {{Linear mixed models are able to handle an extraordinary range of complications in regression-type analyses. Their most common use is to account for within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the standard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in full generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely approximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g., additive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed model framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have general structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response data, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed, computation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS packages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the presence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports special cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or glmmML in R) or relies on the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS macro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general design generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this generalized setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In this article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates sound fitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed models in practice.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract  The spatial prediction methodology that has become known under the heading of kriging is largely based on the assumptions that the underlying random field is Gaussian and the covariance function is exactly known. In practical applications, however, these assumptions will not hold. Beyond Gaussianity of the random field, lognormal kriging, disjunctive kriging, (generalized linear) model-based kriging and trans-Gaussian kriging have been proposed in the literature. The latter approach makes use of the Box–Cox-transform of the data. Still, all the alternatives mentioned do not take into account the uncertainty with respect to the distribution (or transformation) and the estimated covariance function of the data. The Bayesian trans-Gaussian kriging methodology proposed in the present paper is in the spirit of the  ” Bayesian bootstrap” idea advocated by Rubin (Ann Stat 9:130–134, 1981) and avoids the unusual specification of noninformative priors often made in the literature and is entirely based on the sample distribution of the estimators of the covariance function and of the Box–Cox parameter. After some notes on Bayesian spatial prediction, noninformative priors and developing our new methodology finally we will present an example illustrating our pragmatic approach to Bayesian prediction by means of a simulated data set.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a practical and objective procedure for a Bayesian inversion of geophysical data. We have applied geostatistical techniques such as kriging and simulation algorithms to acquire a prior model information. Then the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is adopted to infer the characteristics of the marginal distributions of model parameters. Geostatistics which is based upon a variogram model provides a means to analyze and interpret the spatially distributed data. For Bayesian inversion of dipole-dipole resistivity data, we have used the indicator kriging and simulation techniques to generate cumulative density functions from Schlumberger and well logging data for obtaining a prior information by cokriging and simulations from covariogram models. Indicator approaches make it possible to incorporate non-parametric information into the probabilistic density function. We have also adopted the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, based on Gibbs sampling, to examine the characteristics of a posterior probability density function and marginal distributions of each parameter. The MCMC technique provides a robust result from which information given by the indicator method, that is fundamentally non-parametric, is fully extracted. We have used the a prior information proposed by the geostatistical method as the full conditional distribution for Gibbs sampling. And to implement Gibbs sampler, we have applied the modified Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm which effectively searched for global model space. This scheme provides a more effective and robust global sampling algorithm as compared to the previous study.}},

    abstract = {{Summary.  In many areas of science and technology, mathematical models are built to simulate complex real world phenomena. Such models are typically implemented in large computer programs and are also very complex, such that the way that the model responds to changes in its inputs is not transparent. Sensitivity analysis is concerned with understanding how changes in the model inputs influence the outputs. This may be motivated simply by a wish to understand the implications of a complex model but often arises because there is uncertainty about the true values of the inputs that should be used for a particular application. A broad range of measures have been advocated in the literature to quantify and describe the sensitivity of a model's output to variation in its inputs. In practice the most commonly used measures are those that are based on formulating uncertainty in the model inputs by a joint probability distribution and then analysing the induced uncertainty in outputs, an approach which is known as probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We present a Bayesian framework which unifies the various tools of prob- abilistic sensitivity analysis. The Bayesian approach is computationally highly efficient. It allows effective sensitivity analysis to be achieved by using far smaller numbers of model runs than standard Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, all measures of interest may be computed from a single set of runs.}},

[Technometrics 49 (2007) 138–154] (and briefly summarized below), based on comparison of computer model runs with field data of the process being modeled. The methodology is particularly suited to treating the major issues associated with the validation process: quantifying multiple sources of error and uncertainty in computer models; combining multiple sources of information; and being able to adapt to different, but related scenarios.

Two complications that frequently arise in practice are the need to deal with highly irregular functional data and the need to acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty in the inputs. We develop methodology to deal with both complications. A key part of the approach utilizes a wavelet representation of the functional data, applies a hierarchical version of the scalar validation methodology to the wavelet coefficients, and transforms back, to ultimately compare computer model output with field output. The generality of the methodology is only limited by the capability of a combination of computational tools and the appropriateness of decompositions of the sort (wavelets) employed here.

The methods and analyses we present are illustrated with a test bed dynamic stress analysis for a particular engineering system.}},

In the proposed extension of the sequential kriging optimization method, surrogate systems are exploited to reduce the total evaluation cost. The method utilizes data on all systems to build a kriging metamodel that provides a global prediction of the objective function and a measure of prediction uncertainty. The location and fidelity level of the next evaluation are selected by maximizing an augmented expected improvement function, which is connected with the evaluation costs. The proposed method was applied to test functions from the literature and a metal-forming process design problem via finite element simulations. The method manifests sensible search patterns, robust performance, and appreciable reduction in total evaluation cost as compared to the original method.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Spatial prediction is a problem common to many disciplines. A simple application is the mapping of an attribute recorded at a set of points. Frequently a nonlinear functional of the observed variable is of interest, and this calls for nonlinear approaches to prediction. Nonlinear kriging methods, developed in recent years, endeavour to do so and additionally provide estimates of the distribution of the target quantity conditional on the observations. There are few empirical studies that validate the various forms of nonlinear kriging. This study compares linear and nonlinear kriging methods with respect to precision and their success in modelling prediction uncertainty. The methods were applied to a data set giving measurements of the topsoil concentrations of cobalt and copper at more than 3000 locations in the Border Region of Scotland. The data stem from a survey undertaken to identify places where these trace elements are deficient for livestock. The comparison was carried out by dividing the data set into calibration and validation sets. No clear differences between the precision of ordinary, lognormal, disjunctive, indicator, and model-based kriging were found, neither for linear nor for nonlinear target quantities. Linear kriging, supplemented with the assumption of normally distributed prediction errors, failed to model the conditional distribution of the marginally skewed data, whereas the nonlinear methods modelled the conditional distributions almost equally well. In our study the plug-in methods did not fare any worse than model-based kriging, which takes parameter uncertainty into account.}},

    abstract = {{The problem of calculating posterior probabilities for a collection of competing models and associated Bayes factors continues to be a formidable challenge for applied Bayesian statisticians. Current approaches that take advantage of modern Markov chain Monte Carlo computing methods include those that attempt to sample over some form of the joint space created by the model indicators and the parameters for each model, others that sample over the model space alone, and still others that attempt to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model directly (because the collection of these is equivalent to the collection of model probabilities themselves). We review several methods and compare them in the context of three examples: a simple regression example, a more challenging hierarchical longitudinal model, and a binary data latent variable model. We find that the joint model-parameter space search methods perform adequately but can be difficult to program and tune, whereas the marginal likelihood methods often are less troublesome and require less additional coding. Our results suggest that the latter methods may be most appropriate for practitioners working in many standard model choice settings, but the former remain important for comparing models of varying dimension (e.g., multiple changepoint models) or models whose parameters cannot easily be updated in relatively few blocks. We caution, however, that all methods we compared require significant human and computer effort, and this suggests that less formal Bayesian model choice methods may offer a more realistic alternative in many cases.}},

@article{citeulike:1158372,
    abstract = {{Bayesian methods are experiencing increased use for probabilistic ecological modelling. Most Bayesian inference requires the numerical approximation of analytically intractable integrals. Two methods based on Monte Carlo simulation have appeared in the ecological/environmental modelling literature. Though they sound similar, the Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are very different in their efficiency and effectiveness in providing useful approximations for accurate inference in Bayesian applications. We compare these two methods using a low-dimensional biochemical oxygen demand decay model as an example. We demonstrate that the BMC is extremely inefficient because the prior parameter distribution, from which the Monte Carlo sample is drawn, is often a poor surrogate for the posterior parameter distribution, particularly if the parameters are highly correlated. In contrast, MCMC generates a chain that converges, in distribution, on the posterior parameter distribution, that can be regarded as a sample from the posterior distribution. The inefficiency of the BMC can lead to marginal posterior parameter distributions that appear irregular and may be highly misleading because the important region of the posterior distribution may never be sampled. We also point out that a priori specification of the model error variance can strongly influence the estimation of the principal model parameters. Although the BMC does not require that the model error variance be specified, most published applications have treated this variance as a known constant. Finally, we note that most published BMC applications have chosen a uniform prior distribution, making the BMC more similar to a likelihood-based inference rather than a Bayesian method because the posterior is unaffected by the prior. Though other prior distributions could be applied, the treatment of Monte Carlo samples with any other choice of prior distribution has not been discussed in the BMC literature.}},

This method differs from the currently available UML-based and wizard-based design patterns automation techniques and provides support for increased flexibility, expandability and compatibility in developing software using design patterns. Seven of the patterns proposed by Gamma et al. have been implemented using C++ templates, namely singleton, factory method, visitor, memento, strategy, iterator, and decorator. To illustrate the method proposed, details of singleton and decorator implementations are provided and a larger "check" example developed using the decorator template is presented.

    abstract = {{Free traffic flow on a complex network is key to its normal and efficient functioning. Recent works indicate that many realistic networks possess connecting topologies with a scale-free feature: the probability distribution of the number of links at nodes, or the degree distribution, contains a power-law component. A natural question is then how the topology influences the dynamics of traffic flow on a complex network. Here we present two models to address this question, taking into account the network topology, the information-generating rate, and the information-processing capacity of individual nodes. For each model, we study four kinds of networks: scale-free, random, and regular networks and Cayley trees. In the first model, the capacity of packet delivery of each node is proportional to its number of links, while in the second model, it is proportional to the number of shortest paths passing through the node. We find, in both models, that there is a critical rate of information generation, below which the network traffic is free but above which traffic congestion occurs. Theoretical estimates are given for the critical point. For the first model, scale-free networks and random networks are found to be more tolerant to congestion. For the second model, the congestion condition is independent of network size and topology, suggesting that this model may be practically useful for designing communication protocols.}},

    abstract = {{We study the microscopic time fluctuations of traffic load and the global statistical properties of a dense traffic of particles on scale-free cyclic graphs. For a wide range of driving rates R the traffic is stationary and the load time series exhibits antipersistence due to the regulatory role of the superstructure associated with two hub nodes in the network. We discuss how the superstructure affects the functioning of the network at high traffic density and at the jamming threshold. The degree of correlations systematically decreases with increasing traffic density and eventually disappears when approaching a jamming density R<SUB>c</SUB>. Already before jamming we observe qualitative changes in the global network-load distributions and the particle queuing times. These changes are related to the occurrence of temporary crises in which the network-load increases dramatically, and then slowly falls back to a value characterizing free flow.}},

traffic density arises from an interplay between the dynamics of the flow and

between centrality measures and the density of traffic for some simple particle
hopping models on networks with emerging scale-free degree distributions. We
also study how the speed of the dynamics are affected by the underlying network
structure. Among other conclusions, we find that, even at low traffic
densities, the dynamical measure of traffic density (the occupation ratio) has
a non-trivial dependence on the static centrality (quantified by "betweenness

@article{citeulike:1660998,
    abstract = {{Learning, planning, and representing knowledge at multiple levels of temporal abstraction are key, longstanding challenges for AI. In this paper we consider how these challenges can be addressed within the mathematical framework of reinforcement learning and Markov decision processes (MDPs). We extend the usual notion of action in this framework to include options—closed-loop policies for taking action over a period of time. Examples of options include picking up an object, going to lunch, and traveling to a distant city, as well as primitive actions such as muscle twitches and joint torques. Overall, we show that options enable temporally abstract knowledge and action to be included in the reinforcement learning framework in a natural and general way. In particular, we show that options may be used interchangeably with primitive actions in planning methods such as dynamic programming and in learning methods such as Q-learning. Formally, a set of options defined over an MDP constitutes a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP), and the theory of SMDPs provides the foundation for the theory of options. However, the most interesting issues concern the interplay between the underlying MDP and the SMDP and are thus beyond SMDP theory. We present results for three such cases: (1) we show that the results of planning with options can be used during execution to interrupt options and thereby perform even better than planned, (2) we introduce new intra-option methods that are able to learn about an option from fragments of its execution, and (3) we propose a notion of subgoal that can be used to improve the options themselves. All of these results have precursors in the existing literature; the contribution of this paper is to establish them in a simpler and more general setting with fewer changes to the existing reinforcement learning framework. In particular, we show that these results can be obtained without committing to (or ruling out) any particular approach to state abstraction, hierarchy, function approximation, or the macro-utility problem.}},

    abstract = {{The process of constructing computationally benign approximations of expensive computer simulation codes, or metamodeling, is a critical component of several large-scale multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) approaches. Such applications typically involve complex models, such as finite elements, computational fluid dynamics, or chemical processes. The decision regarding the most appropriate metamodeling approach usually depends on the type of application. However, several newly proposed kernel-based metamodeling approaches can provide consistently accurate performance for a wide variety of applications. The authors recently proposed one such novel and effective metamodeling approach—the extended radial basis function (E-RBF) approach—and reported highly promising results. To further understand the advantages and limitations of this new approach, we compare its performance to that of the typical RBF approach, and another closely related method—kriging. Several test functions with varying problem dimensions and degrees of nonlinearity are used to compare the accuracies of the metamodels using these metamodeling approaches. We consider several performance criteria such as metamodel accuracy, effect of sampling technique, effect of sample size, effect of problem dimension, and computational complexity. The results suggest that the E-RBF approach is a potentially powerful metamodeling approach for MDO-based applications, as well as other classes of computationally intensive applications.}},

Since a probabilistic optimization often involves a double-loop procedure for the overall optimization and iterative probabilistic assessment, the computational demand is extremely high. In this paper, the sequential optimization and reliability assessment (SORA) is developed to improve the efficiency of probabilistic optimization. The SORA method employs a single-loop strategy with a serial of cycles of deterministic optimization and reliability assessment. In each cycle, optimization and reliability assessment are decoupled from each other; the reliability assessment is only conducted after the deterministic optimization to verify constraint feasibility under uncertainty. The key to the proposed method is to shift the boundaries of violated constraints (with low reliability) to the feasible direction based on the reliability information obtained in the previous cycle. The design is quickly improved from cycle to cycle and the computational efficiency is improved significantly. Two engineering applications, the reliability-based design for vehicle crashworthiness of side impact and the integrated reliability and robust design of a speed reducer, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SORA method.}},

The panel consisted of five representatives from industry and government: (1) Andrew J. Booker from The Boeing Company, (2) Dipankar Ghosh from Vanderplaats Research \& Development, (3) Anthony A. Giunta from Sandia National Laboratories, (4) Patrick N. Koch from Engineous Software, Inc., and (5) Ren-Jye Yang from Ford Motor Company. Each panelist was asked to (i) give one or two brief examples of typical uses of approximation methods by his company, (ii) describe the current state-of-the-art of these methods used by his company, (iii) describe the current challenges in the use and adoption of approximation methods within his company, and (iv) identify future research directions in approximation methods. Several common themes arose from the discussion, including differentiating between design of experiments and design and analysis of computer experiments, visualizing experimental results and data from approximation models, capturing uncertainty with approximation methods, and handling problems with large numbers of variables. These are discussed in turn along with the future directions identified by the panelists, which emphasized educating engineers in using approximation methods.}},

We propose a multicriteria optimization approach that effectively simultaneously samples for multiple phenomena. In addition to determining the next sequential sampling point, such an algorithm also can be formulated to support conclusions about the adequacy of the experiment through the use of convergence criteria. A multicriteria adaptive sequential sampling algorithm, along with convergence metrics, is defined and demonstrated on five trial problems of engineering interest. The results of these five problems demonstrate that a multicriteria sequential sampling approach is a useful engineering tool for modeling engineering design spaces using NURBs-based metamodels.}},

The output of a kriging model defines a Gaussian probability distribution when the values of the model parameters are given. In practice, these model parameters must be estimated from observations of the process being modeled (typically a computationally expensive computer model). We found that when the model parameters are treated as random variables instead of known values, the resulting probability distribution of the kriging model can be well approximated by a Student-t distribution, a distribution with fatter tails than the Gaussian or normal distribution. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to determine the probability distributions of the model parameters and the output of the kriging model given the observations. The resulting model parameters were validated against the results of a Bayesian analysis of a simple one-dimensional test problem. The results were also compared to the standard method of Maximum Likelihood Estimation as an alternative method to estimate model parameters.}},

    abstract = {{Among current meta-modelling approaches, Bayesian-based interpolative methods have received significant attention in the literature. These methods are particularly known for their capability to adapt to the response function behaviour in order to generate good meta-models with fewer experiments. Current Bayesian adaptation techniques, however, are mainly based on the assumption that some variables are more important (or sensitive) than others. These less sensitive variables are weighted less or ignored to reduce the dimension of the design space. This assumption limits the scope and applicability of these models since in many practical cases none of the variables can be completely ignored or weighted less than others. This paper proposes a pragmatic approach that identifies regions of the design space where more experiments are needed based on the response function behaviour. The proposed approach adaptively utilizes the information obtained from previous experiments, builds interim meta-models, and identifies 'irregular' regions in which more experiments are needed. The behaviour of the interim meta-model is then quantified as a spatial function and incorporated into the next stage of the design to sequentially improve the accuracy of the obtained meta-model. The performance of the new approach is demonstrated using a numerical and an engineering example. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as  ” modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.}},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}},

In this article, we study the performance of well-known sequential priority queue implementations and the recently proposed parallel access priority queues. To accurately assess the performance of a priority queue, the performance measurement methodology must be appropriate. We use the Classic Hold, the Markov Model, and an Up/Down access pattern to measure performance and look at both the average access time and the worst-case time that are of vital interest to real-tiem applicatons. Our results suggest that the best choice for priority queue algorithms depends heavily on the application. For queue sizes smaller than 1,000 elements, the Splay Tree, the Skew Heap, and Henriksen's algorithm show good average access times. For large queue sized of 5,000 elements or more, the Calendar Queue and the Lazy Queue offer good average access times but have very long worst-case access times. The Skew Heap and the splay Tree exhibit the best worst-case access times.

Many practical priority increment distributions satisfy this condition including unbounded variance distributions like the Pareto distribution. This renders the LadderQ the ideal discrete event queue structure for stable O(1) performance even under practical queue distributions with infinite variance.

To gain insight into the performance of the proposed event set algorithms and allow comparisons with the other selected algorithms, they are tested under a wide variety of conditions in an experimental way. The time needed for the execution of the Hold operation is taken as the measure for estimating the average time complexity of the algorithms.

The computation burden is often caused by expensive analysis and simulation processes in order to reach a comparable level of accuracy as physical testing data.

Metamodeling techniques have been developed from many different disciplines including statistics, mathematics, computer science, and various engineering disciplines. These metamodels are initially developed as \&ldquo;surrogates\&rdquo; of the expensive simulation process in order to improve the overall computation efficiency. They are then found to be a valuable tool to support a wide scope of activities in modern engineering design, especially design optimization.

    abstract = {{Complex nonlinear dynamics arise in many fields of science and engineering, but uncovering the underlying differential equations directly from observations poses a challenging task. The ability to symbolically model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first time a method that can automatically generate symbolic equations for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described using sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations, and assumes that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable. Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be provided manually. The advance presented here is made possible by allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately, intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four simulated and two real systems spanning mechanics, ecology, and systems biology. Unlike numerical models, symbolic models have explanatory value, suggesting that automated  ” reverse engineering” approaches for model-free symbolic nonlinear system identification may play an increasing role in our ability to understand progressively more complex systems in the future.}},

@article{citeulike:1454645,
    abstract = {{Abstract  Many optimization methods for simulation-based design rely on the sequential use of metamodels to reduce the associated computational burden. In particular, kriging models are frequently used in variable fidelity optimization. Nevertheless, such methods may become computationally inefficient when solving problems with large numbers of design variables and/or sampled data points due to the expensive process of optimizing the kriging model parameters in each iteration. One solution to this problem would be to replace the kriging models with traditional Taylor series response surface models. Kriging models, however, were shown to provide good approximations of computer simulations that incorporate larger amounts of data, resulting in better global accuracy. In this paper, a metamodel update management scheme (MUMS) is proposed to reduce the cost of using kriging models sequentially by updating the kriging model parameters only when they produce a poor approximation. The scheme uses the trust region ratio (TR-MUMS), which is a ratio that compares the approximation to the true model. Two demonstration problems are used to evaluate the proposed method: an internal combustion engine sizing problem and a control-augmented structural design problem. The results indicate that the TR-MUMS approach is very effective; on the demonstration problems, it reduced the number of likelihood evaluations by three orders of magnitude compared to using a global optimizer to find the kriging parameters in every iteration. It was also found that in trust region-based method, the kriging model parameters need not be updated using a global optimizer—local methods perform just as well in terms of providing a good approximation without affecting the overall convergence rate, which, in turn, results in a faster execution time.}},

    abstract = {{Many simulation experiments require much computer time, so they necessitate interpolation for sensitivity analysis and optimization. The interpolating functions are 'metamodels' (or 'response surfaces') of the underlying simulation models. Classic methods combine low-order polynomial regression analysis with fractional factorial designs. Modern Kriging provides 'exact' interpolation, i.e., predicted output values at inputs already observed equal the simulated output values. Such interpolation is attractive in deterministic simulation, and is often applied in Computer Aided Engineering. In discrete-event simulation, however, Kriging has just started. Methodologically, a Kriging metamodel covers the whole experimental area; i.e., it is global (not local). Kriging often gives better global predictions than regression analysis. Technically, Kriging gives more weight to 'neighboring' observations. To estimate the Kriging metamodel, space filling designs are used; for example, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). This paper also presents novel, customized (application driven) sequential designs based on cross-validation and bootstrapping.}},

    abstract = {{Many simulation practitioners can get more from their analyses by using the statistical theory on design of experiments (DOE) developed specifically for exploring computer models. We discuss a toolkit of designs for simulators with limited DOE expertise who want to select a design and an appropriate analysis for their experiments. Furthermore, we provide a research agenda listing problems in the design of simulation experiments—as opposed to real-world experiments—that require more investigation. We consider three types of practical problems: (1) developing a basic understanding of a particular simulation model or system, (2) finding robust decisions or policies as opposed to so-called optimal solutions, and (3) comparing the merits of various decisions or policies. Our discussion emphasizes aspects that are typical for simulation, such as having many more factors than in real-world experiments, and the sequential nature of the data collection. Because the same problem type may be addressed through different design types, we discuss quality attributes of designs, such as the ease of design construction, the flexibility for analysis, and efficiency considerations. Moreover, the selection of the design type depends on the metamodel (response surface) that the analysts tentatively assume; for example, complicated metamodels require more simulation runs. We present several procedures to validate the metamodel estimated from a specific design, and we summarize a case study illustrating several of our major themes. We conclude with a discussion of areas that merit more work to achieve the potential benefits—either via new research or incorporation into standard simulation or statistical packages.}},

We present the results of the first in-depth study of the structure of Java programs. We have collected a number of Java programs and measured their key structural attributes. We have found evidence that some relationships follow power-laws, while others do not. We have also observed variations that seem related to some characteristic of the application itself.

We studied the links present among Java classes coming from different contexts. In this case, any observable patterns come from social behaviors, rather than software engineering practices.In our analysis, we could observe a regular social network, organized according to a power-law distribution that is typical, for instance, of links among Web pages.

In this paper, we put forward the environment as a first-order abstraction in multiagent systems. This position is motivated by the fact that several aspects of multiagent systems that conceptually do not belong to agents themselves should not be assigned to, or hosted inside the agents. Examples are infrastructure for communication, the topology of a spatial domain or support for the action model. These and other aspects should be considered explicitly. The environment is the natural candidate to encapsulate these aspects.

    abstract = {{We propose a computer-assisted approach to studying the effective continuum behavior of spatially discrete evolution equations. The advantage of the approach is that the "coarse model" (the continuum, effective equation) need not be explicitly constructed. The method only uses a time-integration code for the discrete problem and judicious choices of initial data and integration times; our bifurcation computations are based on the so-called Recursive Projection Method (RPM) with arc-length continuation [Shroff \& Keller, 1993]. The technique is used to monitor features of the genuinely discrete problem such as the pinning of coherent structures and its results are compared to quasi-continuum approaches such as the ones based on Pad\'{e} approximations.}},

The discussion will remain quite basic (and I hope, readable), but I will make every effort to drive home the essential messages: the crystal-clearness of detailed balance, the main problem with Markov chains, the large extent of algorithmic freedom, both in thermodynamic and dynamic Monte Carlo, and the fundamental differences between the two problems.}},

    abstract = {{Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series \_The Art of Computer Programming\_
covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from random number
generators to floating point operations and other optimized arithmetic
algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously written, this book (and
series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work of authoritative scholarship
in classical computer science, but one that can be read and used profitably by
virtually all working programmers.

The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to
use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient
computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations
and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can
be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating
fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and
manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some
knowledge of calculus.

Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of
useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple
problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where
appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable for
college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by
programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's
library.}},

We have developed an algorithm based on clique percolation23, 24 that allows us to investigate the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale, and thus uncover basic relationships characterizing community evolution. Our focus is on networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist for longer if they are capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to change the group composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small groups displays the opposite tendency—the condition for stability is that their composition remains unchanged. We also show that knowledge of the time commitment of members to a given community can be used for estimating the community's lifetime. These findings offer insight into the fundamental differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a control-theoretic approach to the performance management of Internet Web servers to meet service-level agreements. In particular, a CPU frequency management problem is studied to provide response time guarantees with minimal energy cost. It is argued that linear time-invariant modeling and control may not be sufficient for the system to adapt to dynamically varying load conditions. Instead, a Linear-parameter-varying (LPV) approach is presented in this paper, where workload arrival and service parameters are chosen as scheduling parameters to characterize time-varying operating conditions. Modeling the performance management of a Web server as an LPV system has been extensively discussed in this paper; we have derived first-principles models based on analyzing transient and steady-state queueing dynamics as well as empirical models using system identification algorithms. LPV-H<sub>infin</sub> controllers are then designed for the derived LPV system models. Using real Web server workloads, the performance of LPV control compares favorably to various linear control designs and a design based on the conventional queueing theory. The proposed LPV modeling and control framework can be generalized to incorporate more sophisticated workload models and more complicated server environments. In addition, due to the LPV nature of Web systems with respect to load conditions, the proposed approach can be applied to a variety of resource management problems and used for middleware designs}},

With SOC selection and invocation of Web service partners will occur in software at run-time, rather than by software developers at design and compile time. Unfortunately, the marketplace has yet to yield a predominate applications programming interface for the invocation of Web services. This results in software that is deeply ingrained with vendor-specific calls, which is problematic because Web service technology is changing at a rapid pace. In order to leverage the latest developments, code often needs to be heavily refactored to account for changing invocation interfaces.

    abstract = {{Little theory exists in the field of software system measurement. Concepts such as complexity, coupling, cohesion or even size are very often subject to interpretation and appear to have inconsistent definitions in the literature. As a consequence, there is little guidance provided to the analyst attempting to define proper measures for specific problems. Many controversies in the literature are simply misunderstandings and stem from the fact that some people talk about different measurement concepts under the same label (complexity is the most common case). There is a need to define unambiguously the most important measurement concepts used in the measurement of software products. One way of doing so is to define precisely what mathematical properties characterize these concepts, regardless of the specific software artifacts to which these concepts are applied. Such a mathematical framework could generate a consensus in the software engineering community and provide a means for better communication among researchers, better guidelines for analysts, and better evaluation methods for commercial static analyzers for practitioners. We propose a mathematical framework which is generic, because it is not specific to any particular software artifact, and rigorous, because it is based on precise mathematical concepts. We use this framework to propose definitions of several important measurement concepts (size, length, complexity, cohesion, coupling). It does not intend to be complete or fully objective; other frameworks could have been proposed and different choices could have been made. However, we believe that the formalisms and properties we introduce are convenient and intuitive. This framework contributes constructively to a firmer theoretical ground of software measurement}},

    abstract = {{Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are designed to take advantage of recent advances in communications, electronics, and Information Technology in improving the efficiency and safety of transportation systems. Among the several ITS applications is the notion of Dynamic Traffic Routing (DTR), which involves generating �optimal� routing recommendations to drivers with the aim of maximizing network utilizing. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a self-learning intelligent agent to solve the DTR problem to achieve traffic user equilibrium in a transportation network. The core idea is to deploy an agent to a simulation model of a highway. The agent then learns by itself by interacting with the simulation model. Once the agent reaches a satisfactory level of performance, it can then be deployed to the real-world, where it would continue to learn how to refine its control policies over time. To test this concept in this paper, the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) developed by Carlos Daganzo of the University of California at Berkeley is used to simulate a simple highway with two main alternative routes. With the model developed, a Reinforcement Learning Agent (RLA) is developed to learn how to best dynamically route traffic, so as to maximize the utilization of existing capacity. Preliminary results obtained from our experiments are promising. RL, being an adaptive online learning technique, appears to have a great potential for controlling a stochastic dynamic systems such as a transportation system. Furthermore, the approach is highly scalable and applicable to a variety of networks and roadways.}},

Traffic patterns primarily depend on the users' preference for short paths through the network and spatial constraints for building the necessary connections. Here we study the traffic distribution in a network model which takes both of these considerations into account. Assuming users always travel along the shortest path available, the appropriate measure for traffic flow along the links is a generalization of the usual concept of "edge betweenness". We find that for networks with a minimal total construction cost, a small number of connections must handle a disproportionate amount of traffic. However, the introduction of even very few additional links greatly reduces the maximal traffic along any of the links in the network.}},

    abstract = {{Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.}},

These macroscopic modeling tasks, yeilding infomration over long time and large scales, are accomplished through approximately initialized calls to the microscopic simular for only short times and small spatial domains. Traditionally modeling approaches first involve the derivation of macroscopic evolution equations (balances closed through constitutive realtions). An arsenal of analytical and numerical techniques for the efficent solution of such evolution equations (usually Partial Differential Equations, PDEs) is then brought to bear on the problem. Our equation-free (EF) approach, introduced in [1], when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathmatics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann (LB), kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales, "coarse" bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a system identification based, "closure-on-demand" computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/ stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation amd numerical analysis. We will breifly survey the application of these "numerical enabling technology" ideas through examples including the computation of coarsely self-similar solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.}},

Rather, they can only use a subset of ties that are strong enough to be  ” trusted”. In this paper we consider transitivity as evidence of strong ties, requiring that each tie can only be used if the individuals on either end also share at least one other contact in common. We examine the effect of removing all non-transitive ties in two real social network data sets. We observe that although some individuals become disconnected, a giant connected component remains, with an average shortest path only slightly longer than that of the original network. We also evaluate the cost of forming transitive ties by deriving the conditions for the emergence and the size of the giant component in a random graph composed entirely of closed triads and the equivalent Erdos-Renyi random graph.}},

@article{citeulike:1158225,
    abstract = {{Centrality measures, or at least popular interpretations of these measures, make implicit assumptions about the manner in which traffic flows through a network. For example, some measures count only geodesic paths, apparently assuming that whatever flows through the network only moves along the shortest possible paths. This paper lays out a typology of network flows based on two dimensions of variation, namely the kinds of trajectories that traffic may follow (geodesics, paths, trails, or walks) and the method of spread (broadcast, serial replication, or transfer). Measures of centrality are then matched to the kinds of flows that they are appropriate for. Simulations are used to examine the relationship between type of flow and the differential importance of nodes with respect to key measurements such as speed of reception of traffic and frequency of receiving traffic. It is shown that the off-the-shelf formulas for centrality measures are fully applicable only for the specific flow processes they are designed for, and that when they are applied to other flow processes they get the  ” wrong” answer. It is noted that the most commonly used centrality measures are not appropriate for most of the flows we are routinely interested in. A key claim made in this paper is that centrality measures can be regarded as generating expected values for certain kinds of node outcomes (such as speed and frequency of reception) given implicit models of how traffic flows, and that this provides a new and useful way of thinking about centrality.}},

Instead of using the routing strategy for shortest path, we give a generalized routing algorithm to find the so-called efficient path, which considers the possible congestion in the nodes along actual paths. Since the nodes with the largest degree are very susceptible to traffic congestion, an effective way to improve traffic and control congestion, as our strategy, can be redistributing traffic load in central nodes to other noncentral nodes. Simulation results indicate that the network capability in processing traffic is improved more than 10 times by optimizing the efficient path, which is in good agreement with the analysis.}},

Degree-based centrality is in principle identical for egocentric and sociocentric network data. A closeness measure is uninformative for egocentric data, since all geodesic distances from ego to other nodes in the first-order zone are 1 by definition. The extent to which egocentric and sociocentric versions of Freeman's betweenness centrality measure correspond is explored empirically. Across seventeen diverse networks, that correspondence is found to be relatively close—though variations in egocentric network composition do lead to some notable differences in egocentric and sociocentric betweennness. The findings suggest that research design has a relatively modest impact on assessing the relative betweenness of nodes, and that a betweenness measure based on egocentric network data could be a reliable substitute for Freeman's betweenness measure when it is not practical to collect complete network data. However, differences in the research methods used in sociocentric and egocentric studies could lead to additional differences in the respective betweenness centrality measures.}},

    abstract = {{The concept of centrality is often invoked in social network analysis, and diverse indices have been proposed to measure it. This paper develops a unified framework for the measurement of centrality. All measures of centrality assess a node's involvement in the walk structure of a network. Measures vary along four key dimensions: type of nodal involvement assessed, type of walk considered, property of walk assessed, and choice of summary measure. If we cross-classify measures by type of nodal involvement (radial versus medial) and property of walk assessed (volume versus length), we obtain a four-fold polychotomization with one cell empty which mirrors Freeman's 1979 categorization. At a more substantive level, measures of centrality summarize a node's involvement in or contribution to the cohesiveness of the network. Radial measures in particular are reductions of pair-wise proximities/cohesion to attributes of nodes or actors. The usefulness and interpretability of radial measures depend on the fit of the cohesion matrix to the one-dimensional model. In network terms, a network that is fit by a one-dimensional model has a core-periphery structure in which all nodes revolve more or less closely around a single core. This in turn implies that the network does not contain distinct cohesive subgroups. Thus, centrality is shown to be intimately connected with the cohesive subgroup structure of a network.}},

We also identify brokers who act as links between sub-communities and who appear to be crucial to the social cohesion of the population as a whole. The network is found to be similar to human social networks in some respects but different in some others, such as the level of assortative mixing by degree within the population.

In Focus, systems are composed of interacting components. A component is a total behavior. We introduce a formal model of services where, in contrast, a service is a partial behavior. For services and components, we work out foundational specification techniques and outline methodological development steps. We show how services can be structured and how software architectures can be composed of services and components.

In this paper, we aim to execute independent tasks efficiently on HPCEs. We consider the problem to find a schedule that maximizes the throughput of task execution for a huge number of independent tasks. First, for HPCEs where the network forms a directed acyclic graph, we show that we can find, in polynomial time, a schedule that attains the optimal throughput. Secondly, for arbitrary HPCEs, we propose an (3/2 + {epsilon})-approximation algorithm for any constant {epsilon}({epsilon} > 0). In addition, we also show that the framework of our approximation algorithm can be applied to other collective communications such as the gather operation.},

    abstract = {{R is an Open Source implementation of the well-known S language. It works on multiple computing platforms and can be freely downloaded. R is thus ideally suited for teaching at many levels as well as for practical data analysis and methodological development. This book provides an elementary-level introduction to R, targeting both non-statistician scientists in various fields and students of statistics. The main mode of presentation is via code examples with liberal commenting of the code and the output, from the computational as well as the statistical viewpoint. Brief sections introduce the statistical methods before they are used. A supplementary R package can be downloaded and contains the data sets. All examples are directly runnable and all graphics in the text are generated from the examples. The statistical methodology covered includes statistical standard distributions, one- and two-sample tests with continuous data, regression analysis, one- and two-way analysis of variance, regression analysis, analysis of tabular data, and sample size calculations. In addition, the last four chapters contain introductions to multiple linear regression analysis, linear models in general, logistic regression, and survival analysis. Peter Dalgaard is associate professor at the Biostatistical Department at the University of Copenhagen and has extensive experience in teaching within the PhD curriculum at the Faculty of Health Sciences. He was chairman of the Danish Society for Theoretical Statistics from 1996 to 2000. Peter Dalgaard has been a key member of the R Core Team since August 1997 and is well known among R users for his activity on the R mailing lists.}},

The effectiveness of a  ” modularization” is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.}},

    abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) concerns the problem of a learning agent interacting with its environment to achieve a goal. Instead of being given examples of desired behavior, the learning agent must discover by trial and error how to behave in order to get the most reward. The environment is a Markov decision process (MDP) with state set, \$\$ \mathcal{S} \$\$ , and action set, \$\$ \mathcal{A} \$\$ . The agent and the environment interact in a sequence of discrete steps, t = 0, 1, 2,... The state and action at one time step, \$\$ s\_t \in \mathcal{S} \$\$ and \$\$ a\_t \in \mathcal{A} \$\$ , determine the probability distribution for the state at the next time step, \$\$ s\_{t + 1} \in \mathcal{S} \$\$ and, jointly, the distribution for the next reward, r t+1 ∈ ℜ. The agent's objective is to chose each aint to maximize the subsequent return: \$\$ R\_t = \sum\limits\_{k = 0}^\infty {\gamma ^k r\_{t + 1 + k} ,} \$\$ where the discount rate, 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1, determines the relative weighting of immediate and delayed rewards. In some environments, the interaction consists of a sequence of episodes, each starting in a given state and ending upon arrival in a terminal state, terminating the series above. In other cases the interaction is continual, without interruption, and the sum may have an infinite number of terms (in which case we usually assume γ \&lt; 1). Infinite horizon cases with γ = 1 are also possible though less common (e.g., see Mahadevan, 1996).},

    abstract = {{Complex behavior often resists clean modularization in object-oriented languages. Aspect-oriented programming tackles this problem by providing flexible module boundaries that can span and partition classes. However, in order to achieve this flexibility, valuable modularity mechanisms, such as encapsulation and external composition, are lost. The ability to separately compile or reason about a modular unit is also compromised. We propose that this tradeoff is not necessary and that by expressing aspects as part of our modules, we can restore the lost modular properties while maintaining aspectual features. As a concrete demonstration, we present the main features of Aspectual Collaborations and show how these interact to combine modularity with aspectual behavior. The expressiveness of Aspectual Collaborations, AspectJ and Hyper/J are compared using a challenge problem, allowing us to estimate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

@article{citeulike:1120140,
    abstract = {{The relationships between coupling and external quality factors of object-oriented software have been studied extensively for the past few years. For example, several studies have identified clear empirical relationships between class-level coupling and class fault-proneness. A common way to define and measure coupling is through structural properties and static code analysis. However, because of polymorphism, dynamic binding, and the common presence of unused ("dead") code in commercial software, the resulting coupling measures are imprecise as they do not perfectly reflect the actual coupling taking place among classes at runtime. For example, when using static analysis to measure coupling, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to determine what actual methods can be invoked from a client class if those methods are overridden in the subclasses of the server classes. Coupling measurement has traditionally been performed using static code analysis, because most of the existing work was done on nonobject oriented code and because dynamic code analysis is more expensive and complex to perform. For modern software systems, however, this focus on static analysis can be problematic because although dynamic binding existed before the advent of object-orientation, its usage has increased significantly in the last decade. We describe how coupling can be defined and precisely measured based on dynamic analysis of systems. We refer to this type of coupling as dynamic coupling. An empirical evaluation of the proposed dynamic coupling measures is reported in which we study the relationship of these measures with the change proneness of classes. Data from maintenance releases of a large Java system are used for this purpose. Preliminary results suggest that some dynamic coupling measures are significant indicators of change proneness and that they complement existing coupling measures based on static analysis.}},

In response to this need, a number of researchers have developed various metrics for object-oriented systems as proposed aids to the management of these systems. In this research, an analysis of a set of metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer (1994) is performed in order to assess their usefulness for practising managers. First, an informal introduction to the metrics is provided by way of an extended example of their managerial use. Second, exploratory analyses of empirical data relating the metrics to productivity, rework effort and design effort on three commercial object-oriented systems are provided. The empirical results suggest that the metrics provide significant explanatory power for variations in these economic variables, over and above that provided by traditional measures, such as size in lines of code, and after controlling for the effects of individual developers}},

When used in conjunction with measures of other attributes, coupling and cohesion can contribute to an assessment or prediction of software quality. Let a graph be an abstraction of a software system and let a subgraph represent a module (subsystem). The paper proposes information theory based measures of coupling and cohesion of a modular system. These measures have the properties of system level coupling and cohesion defined by L.C. Briand et al. (1996; 1997). Coupling is based on relationships between modules. We also propose a similar measure for intramodule coupling based on an intramodule abstraction of the software, rather than intermodule, but intramodule coupling is calculated in the same way as intermodule coupling. We define cohesion in terms of intramodule coupling, normalized to between zero and one. We illustrate the measures with example graphs. Preliminary analysis showed that the information theory approach has finer discrimination than counting}},

We present a distributed architecture, implemented in a realistic prototype data center, that demonstrates how utility functions can enable a collection of autonomic elements to continually optimize the use of computational resources in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment. Broadly, the architecture is a two-level structure of independent autonomic elements that supports flexibility, modularity, and self-management. Individual autonomic elements manage application resource usage to optimize local service-level utility functions, and a global arbiter allocates resources among application environments based on resource-level utility functions obtained from the managers of the applications.

    abstract = {{We present a tentative proposal for a quantitative measure of autonomy. This is something that, surprisingly, seems to be missing from the literature, even though autonomy is considered to be a basic concept in many disciplines, including artificial life. We work in an information-theoretic setting for which the distinction between system and environment is the starting point. We propose as a measure for autonomy the conditional mutual information between consecutive states of the system conditioned on the history of the environment. This works well when the system cannot influence the environment at all. When, in contrast, the system has full control over its environment, we should rather neglect the environment history and simply take the mutual information between consecutive system states as a measure of autonomy. This discussion reveals some subtle facets of the concept of autonomy, ultimately leading towards the ambitious issue of autonomy as a fundamental (defining) concept of life itself. In our formalization, these aspects question the seemingly innocent system-environment distinction we took for granted and raise the issue of the attribution of control, i.e., the responsibility for observed effects. To further explore these issues, we evaluate our autonomy measure for simple automata, an agent moving in space, gliders in the game of life, and the tessellation automaton for autopoiesis by Varela et al.}},

Agent-oriented methodologies today are mainly focussed on engineering the microscopic issues, i.e. the agents, their rules, how they interact, etc, without explicit support for engineering the required macroscopic behaviour. As a consequence, the macroscopic behaviour is achieved in an ad-hoc manner. This paper proposes a way to define a full life-cycle methodology based on an industry-ready software engineering process, i.e. the Unified Process, which is customised to explicitly focus on engineering macroscopic behaviour of self-organising emergent MASs. As such, the MAS paradigm is integrated into an existing and widely accepted methodology and we can systematically develop a solution that exhibits the required macroscopic behaviour.}},

    abstract = {{We present and discuss a framework for computer-aided multiscale analysis, which enables models at a "fine" (microscopic/stochastic) level of description to perform modeling tasks at a "coarse" (macroscopic, systems) level. These macroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space scales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the microscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our equation-free (EF) approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann (LB), kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) or Molecular Dynamics (MD) microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales,"coarse" bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a systems identification based, "closure on demand" computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas through examples from chemical kinetics (LB, KMC), rheology (Brownian Dynamics), homogenization and the computation of "coarsely self-similar" solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.}},

The paper compares and combines these theories into a coherent model of software development that links software coupling and dependency management with team productivity. As a practical test of this model, the paper then investigates, the effects of coupling in two large commercial systems. It achieves this by using the VCML Views visualisation technique, developed by the authors, to expose the system wide coupling found in the code and how this coupling develops during the lifetime of a project. It then compares the resultant VCML views with simple attributes of the two projects to derive a set of important conclusions. In particular, it finds that unmanaged coupling within the code is a good indicator of potential productivity bottlenecks; that the number of programmers on a project is not necessarily a good indicator of programmer productivity; and that the architecture of a software system can radically alter the number of programmers that can effectively work together on a system.}},

    abstract = {{The neo-Darwinian view of evolution centres upon the role of the gene. Here there seems to be little scope for self-organization. This conclusion is reinforced by traditional models of polymorphism in terms of allele frequencies in a mean-field gene-pool. However, models based on phenotypes, and including nonlinear and collective effects, suggest that evolution can indeed be viewed as a process whereby the ecosystem self-organizes. Here we focus on the phenomenon of speciation, and discuss a series of phenotypic models which together illuminate some of the issues surrounding the role of self-organization, including new approaches to fitness landscapes and species selection. All of these models represent speciation as a symmetry-breaking bifurcation, but in different mathematical contexts including deterministic dynamical systems, stochastic dynamical systems, and iterated function schemes. The main conclusions are surprisingly robust, despite the diversity of the models.}},

Emergence science describes how higher-level self-regulatory behaviour arises in natural systems from many participants following simple rule-sets. Emergence advocates simple communication models, autonomy and independence, enhancing robustness and self-stabilization. High-quality distributed applications such as autonomic systems must satisfy the appropriate nonfunctional requirements which include scalability, efficiency, robustness, low-latency and stability. However the traditional design of distributed applications, especially in terms of the communication strategies employed, can introduce compromises between these characteristics. This paper discusses ways in which emergence science can be applied to distributed computing, avoiding some of the compromises associated with traditionally-designed applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this paradigm, an emergent election algorithm is described and its performance evaluated. The design incorporates nondeterministic behaviour. The resulting algorithm has very low communication complexity, and is simultaneously very stable, scalable and robust.}},

    abstract = {{Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising new approach to systems performance management that differs radically from standard queuing-theoretic approaches making use of explicit system performance models. In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic model and with little or no built-in system specific knowledge. In our original work [1], [2], [3] we showed the feasibility of using online RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which can be used to make high-quality server allocation decisions in a multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a hybrid approach in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid suffering potentially poor performance in live online training. We also now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e.g. multi-layer perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that in both open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory.}},

How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various "tricks of the trade". This article is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC-and to not-so-novice users as well.

    abstract = {{An important aspect of designing a distributed application is the communication model we use to connect its various components. Some middleware solutions, such as Web services, offer two of the most important communication paradigms: asynchronous messaging and remote procedure call (RPC). Message-oriented middleware (MOM) lets a service's consumers physically and temporally decouple from the service providers. Communication between service providers and the consumers is asynchronous, and it don't need to be available at the same time because they communicate by sending and receiving messages from designated message queues. In contrast, RPC is a synchronous method of requesting remote service execution. Consumers must suspend service execution until they receive a reply from the provider. MOM and RPC have advantages and disadvantages. MOM solutions tend to be more robust to failures than RPC, and it allows service requesters to continue to process while service provider's work on their requests. However, programming MOM-based applications is more cumbersome because distribution isn't as transparent to the programmer as with RPCs. In this column, we provide a quantitative framework, which we can use to compare MOM- and RPC-based solutions.}},

    abstract = {{Row displacement dispatch tables implement message dispatching for dynamically-typed languages with a run time overhead of one memory indirection plus an equality test. The technique is similar to virtual function table lookup, which is, however, restricted to statically typed languages like C++. We show how to reduce the space requirements of dispatch tables to approximately the same size as virtual function tables. The scheme is then generalized for multiple inheritance. Experiments on a number of class libraries from five different languages demonstrate that the technique is effective for a broad range of programs. Finally, we discuss optimizations of the row displacement algorithm that allow dispatch table construction of these large samples to take place in a few seconds.}},

    abstract = {{Considering the urgency of the need for standards which would allow constitution of heterogeneous computer networks, ISO created a new subcommittee for "Open Systems Interconnection" (ISO/ TC97/SC 16) in 1977. The first priority of subcommittee 16 was to develop an architecture for open systems interconnection which could serve as a framework for the definition of standard protocols. As a result of 18 months of studies and discussions, SC16 adopted a layered architecture comprising seven layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). In July 1979 the specifications of this architecture, established by SC16, were passed under the name of "OSI Reference Model" to Technical Committee 97 "Data Processing" along with recommendations to start officially, on this basis, a set of protocols standardization projects to cover the most urgent needs. These recommendations were adopted by T.C97 at the end of 1979 as the basis for the following development of standards for Open Systems Interconnectlon within ISO. The OSI Reference Model was also recognized by CCITT Rapporteur's Group on "Layered Model for Public Data Network Services." This paper presents the model of architecture for Open Systems Interconnection developed by SC16. Some indications are also given on the initial set of protocols which will-likely be developed in this OSI Reference Model.}},

@article{citeulike:889960,
    abstract = {{Anyone intent on developing a Java-based framework for enterprise integration would do well to keep a few things in mind. One lesson is that today's Java programmers want to write Java, not stylized or otherwise "special" Java that must incorporate framework-specific artifacts. Another lesson is that standardizing a suitable integration-focused framework would be a good idea, given that the alternative is to add yet another proprietary system to a field already rife with stove-piped solutions that don't work together. The most important lesson, however, could well be that when it comes to integration, Java can't solve it all. Making it possible for solutions outside traditional Java programming to work within the framework is thus a necessity, not a nicety. One standards effort currently targeting the business-integration space is Java Specification Request 208, entitled "Java Business Integration" (JBI). Like other JSRs in the Java Community Process, JBI obviously has to work with the Java 2 platform - in this case, both the standard and enterprise editions (J2SE and J2EE, respectively). It also wisely goes beyond the Java-centric focus in most JSRs and aims to accommodate implementation alternatives outside the pure Java space. The approach underlying JBI is a bit unusual compared to other JSRs in that it uses Web services at its core. Rather than focusing on how to build Web services using Java, it promotes an architecture that's strongly based on Web services' principles and approaches.}},

    abstract = {{When designing decentralised autonomic computing systems, a fundamental engineering issue is to assess systemwide behaviour. Such decentralised systems are characterised by the lack of global control, typically consist of autonomous cooperating entities, and often rely on self-organised emergent behaviour to achieve the requirements. A well-founded and practically feasible approach to study overall system behaviour is a prerequisite for successful deployment. On one hand, formal proofs of correct behaviour and even predictions of the exact systemwide behaviour are practically infeasible due to the complex, dynamic, and often non-deterministic nature of selforganising emergent systems. On the other hand, simple simulations give no convincing arguments for guaranteeing system-wide properties. We describe an alternative approach that allows to analyse and assess trends in systemwide behaviour, based on so-called "equation-free" macroscopic analysis. This technique yields more reliable results about the system-wide behaviour, compared to mere observation of simulation results, at an affordable computational cost. Numerical algorithms act at the system-wide level and steer the simulations. This allows to limit the amount of simulations considerably. We illustrate the approach by studying a particular system-wide property of a decentralised control system for Automated Guided Vehicles and we outline a road map towards a general methodology for studying decentralised autonomic computing systems.}},

Two-phase commit is also not suitable for transactions with some long sub-transactions. Compensation is a way to ensure transaction reliability. However, rolling back a previously completed transaction is potentially expensive. Thus, tentative holding is another option.

    abstract = {{We revisit the problem of interval estimation of a binomial proportion. The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted.

This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.}},

We here propose a grid workflow system (grid-WFS), a flexible failure handling framework for the grid, which addresses these grid-unique failure recovery requirements. Central to the framework is flexibility by the use of workflow structure as a high-level recovery policy specification. We show how this use of high-level workflow structure allows users to achieve failure recovery in a variety of ways depending on the requirements and constraints of their applications. We also demonstrate that this use of workflow structure enables users to not only rapidly prototype and investigate failure handling strategies, but also easily change them by simply modifying the encompassing workflow structure, while the application code remains intact. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of our framework using a simulation, demonstrating the value of supporting multiple failure recovery techniques in grid systems to achieve high performance in the presence of failures.}},

We consider sites that are organized around a set of items available for purchase or download, consider, for example, an e-commerce site or collection of online research papers, and we study a simple indicator of collective user interest in an item, the batting average, defined as the fraction of visits to an item's description that result in an acquisition of that item. We develop a stochastic model for identifying points in time at which an item's batting average experiences significant change. In experiments with usage data from the Internet Archive, we find that such changes often occur in an abrupt, discrete fashion, and that these changes can be closely aligned with events such as the highlighting of an item on the site or the appearance of a link from an active external referrer. In this way, analyzing the dynamics of item popularity at an active web site can help characterize the impact of a range of events taking place both on and off the site.}},

modify it to accommodate the bounded rationality of all real-world players. A
recurring issue in statistical physics is how best to approximate joint
probability distributions with decoupled (and therefore far more tractable)
distributions. This paper shows that the same information theoretic
mathematical structure, known as Product Distribution (PD) theory, addresses
both issues. In this, PD theory not only provides a principled formulation of
bounded rationality and a set of new types of mean field theory in statistical
physics. It also shows that those topics are fundamentally one and the same.}},

However, while industry standards for the description, composition, and orchestration of Web services have been under discussion (and development) for quite some time already, their conceptual underpinnings are still in their infancy. Indeed, conceptual models/or service specification are rare so far, as are investigations based on them.

Importantly, the model allows for specification of desirable composition properties at all levels. Different ways of achieving these properties as well as implications of the model are addressed.}},

The number and type of on-line services increase day by day, and this trend is likely to continue at an even faster pace in the immediate future. Examples of e-services currently available include bill payment, delivery of customized news, or archiving and sharing of digital documents. E-Services are typically delivered individually. However, the e-service market creates the opportunity for providing value-added, integrated services, which are delivered by composing existing e-services. To support organizations in pursuing this business opportunity we have developed eFlow, a system that supports the specification, enactment, and management of composite e-services, modeled as processes that are enacted by a service process engine. Composite e-services have to cope with a highly dynamic business environment in terms of services and of service providers. In addition, the increased competition forces companies to provide customized services to better satisfy the needs of every individual customer. Ideally, service process should be able to transparently adapt to changes in the environment and to the need of different customers with minimal or no user intervention. In addition, it should be possible to dynamically modify service process definitions in a simple and effective way to manage cases where user intervention is indeed required. In this paper we show how eFlow achieves these goals.}},

Application development is often done in an ad hoc manner, without standard frameworks or libraries, thus resulting in poor reuse of software assets. Web services have received much interest in industry due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web services composition tool can help automate the process, from creating business process functionality, to developing executable workflows, to deploying them on an execution environment. However, we find that the main approaches taken thus far to standardize and compose web services are piecemeal and insufficient. The business world has adopted a (distributed) programming approach in which web service instances are described using WSDL, composed into flows with a language like BPEL and invoked with the SOAP protocol. Academia has propounded the AI approach of formally representing web service capabilities in ontologies, and reasoning about their composition using goal-oriented inferencing techniques from planning. We present the first integrated work in composing web services end to end from specification to deployment by synergistically combining the strengths of the above approaches. We describe a prototype service creation environment along with a use-case scenario, and demonstrate how it can significantly speed up the time-to-market for new services.}},

Errors, ambiguities, and misunderstandings are cleared by constant exposure" (p. 151). However, the most illuminating aspect of their discussion of the role of proving theorems in mathematics is that theorem proving, in the best instances, increases "understanding by revealing the heart of matter" (p. 151). To the author of this paper, Leslie Lamport, "structured proofs", if not written appropriately, may fail to become more rigorous than conventional ones even though they communicate better messages. Reading very carefully through the paper several times, I remain unconvinced that the structured proof, say the one applied to the irrationality of the square root of 2, is a "good" one. My reason is simple: the standard of rigor for a mathematical proof evolves over time. Of course, a "good" proof should be as rigorous as possible. Yet it is not good enough unless it is able to convey as many messages as possible in an acceptable length. Nonetheless, the author should not be blamed for telling us how to write a good proof in terms of his perspectives.

This "expert-friendly" system has a powerful command language and programming environment, combined with an active user community. We discuss how R is ideal as a platform to support experimentation in mathematical statistics, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Using a series of case studies and activities, we describe how R can be used in a mathematical statistics course as a toolbox for experimentation. Examples include the calculation of a running average, maximization of a nonlinear function, resampling of a statistic, simple Bayesian modeling, sampling from multivariate normal, and estimation of power. These activities, often requiring only a few dozen lines of code, offer students the opportunity to explore statistical concepts and experiment. In addition, they provide an introduction to the framework and idioms available in this rich environment.}},

There has been no disagreement among research methodologists about the desirability of power analysis in research planning and assessment, yet progress in application of this method over the last quarter century has been slow. There have, however, been some rays of hope in the past few years. The popularity of meta-analysis has served to emphasize the size of effects and by thus raising the consciousness of behavioral scientists has promoted the cause of power analysis. More directly, both graduate and undergraduate statistics textbooks have begun to feature chapter-length treatments of power analysis. Finally, in addition to the reference works already noted, there are available computer programs for power analysis and sample size determination.}},

    abstract = {{The demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today. However, application development is often done in an ad hoc manner resulting in poor reuse of software assets and longer time-to-delivery. Web services have received much interest due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web service composition system can help automate the process, from specifying business process functionalities, to developing executable workflows that capture non-functional (e.g. Quality of Service (QoS)) requirements, to deploying them on a runtime infrastructure. Intuitively, web services can be viewed as software components and the process of web service composition similar to software synthesis. In addition, service composition needs to address the build-time and runtime issues of the integrated application, thereby making it a more challenging and practical problem than software synthesis. However, current solutions based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP, etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning, etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient. We formulate the web service composition problem and describe the first integrated system for composing web services end to end, i.e., from specification to deployment. The proposed solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. We also present Synthy, a prototype of the service composition system, and demonstrate its effectiveness with the help of an application scenario from the telecom domain.}},

The challenge, which we undertake in this paper, is to systematically address workflow requirements, from basic to complex. Many of the more complex requirements identified, recur quite frequently in the analysis phases of workflow projects, however their implementation is uncertain in current products. Requirements for workflow languages are indicated through workflow patterns. In this context, patterns address business requirements in an imperative workflow style expression, but are removed from specific workflow languages. The paper describes a number of workflow patterns addressing what we believe identify comprehensive workflow functionality. These patterns provide the basis for an in-depth comparison of a number of commercially availablework flow management systems. As such, this paper can be seen as the academic response to evaluations made by prestigious consulting companies. Typically, these evaluations hardly consider the workflow modeling language and routing capabilities, and focus more on the purely technical and commercial aspects.}},

Historically, different disciplines have approached this problem using different techniques and assumptions, with few unifying efforts made. However, the field of neuroeconomics has recently emerged as an inter-disciplinary effort to bridge this gap. Research in neuroscience and psychology has begun to investigate neural bases of decision predictability and value, central parameters in the economic theory of expected utility. Economics, in turn, is being increasingly influenced by a multiple-systems approach to decision-making, a perspective strongly rooted in psychology and neuroscience. The integration of these disparate theoretical approaches and methodologies offers exciting potential for the construction of more accurate models of decision-making.}},

However, a computational model specifying how people select strategies from their repertoire is still lacking. The proposed strategy selection learning (SSL) theory predicts a strategy selection process on the basis of reinforcement learning. The theory assumes that individuals develop subjective expectations for the strategies they have and select strategies proportional to their expectations, which are then updated on the basis of subsequent experience. The learning assumption was supported in 4 experimental studies. Participants substantially improved their inferences through feedback. In all 4 studies, the best-performing strategy from the participants' repertoires most accurately predicted the inferences after sufficient learning opportunities. When testing SSL against 3 models representing extensions of SSL and against an exemplar model assuming a memory-based inference process, the authors found that SSL predicted the inferences most accurately.}},

Many believe that Web services is a distributed systems technology that relies on some form of distributed object technology. Unfortunately, this is not the only common misconception about Web services. We seek to clarify several widely held beliefs about the technology that are partially or completely wrong. Within the distributed technology world, it is probably more appropriate to associate Web services with messaging technologies because they share a common architectural view, although they address different application types.

We then outline what we believe is the appropriate paradigm for theorizing about the role of energy and information in biological processes; in essence, our paradigm is cybernetic. This is followed by a brief discussion of thermodynamics, with particular reference to its application to living systems. Two concepts that are well developed in the engineering literature but not commonly used elsewhere provide an approach that we believe is both more rigorous and more readily understood, namely the ?control volume? frame of reference and the concept of ?available energy?. Both of these concepts are defined in precise mathematical terms. We also critique some of the misuses of thermodynamic concepts. In Part II, we will discuss what we call the ?thermoeconomics? of living systems - that is, a cybernetic and economic approach to analyzing the role of available energy in biological evolution - and we will relate this paradigm to a distinction that we draw between various statistical and/or structural definitions of information and what we call ?control information?. We will critique information theory and we will define control information in cybernetic terms not as a ?thing? but as an attribute of the relationships between things - namely, the capacity (know-how) to control the acquisition, disposition and utilization of matter/energy in purposive (teleonomic) processes. We will also suggest how control information can be measured empirically, and we will propose a methodology for linking thermodynamics and information theory that contrasts sharply with existing approaches to this problem. Finally, we will argue that in living systems thermodynamic processes may be subject to certain law-like ?bioeconomic? principles. We will also elucidate some implications. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

    comment = {(private-note)This article gives some detailed insights into the philosophy of science with respect to a systems theory of using thermoeconomics. Also, it attempts to explain the different aspects of entropy in the scientific literature and concludes with his own understanding of thermodynamics and entropy understanding of systems science.
Interesting to remember is his cybernetic approach to systems science. From the article it appears that this is the right framework to follow in my own research. Herman Haken is one of the leading cyberneticists and it would be necessary to read the references to his articles.
Also, the distinction of self-organisation and self-ordering is important, because Ilya Prigogine's Bernard cells might fall into the self-ordering category. Again, it would be important to understand the distinction between both and the criticism Corning lends to existing work (past and recent work).},

However, the storing those values in a registry is a better alternative than storing those values on the service-provider side, because the service provider may tamper with the data. On the other hand, the registry is an open broker architecture and updating the values there might allow competitors to tamper with someone elses data.

    abstract = {{Web services are the key technology for implementing distributed enterprise level applications such as B2B and grid computing. An important goal is to provide dependable quality guarantees for client-server interactions. Therefore, service level management (SLM) is gaining more and more significance for clients and providers of Web services. The first step to control service level agreements is a proper instrumentation of the application code in order to monitor the service performance. However, manual instrumentation of Web services is very costly and error-prone and thus not very efficient. Our goal was to develop a systematic and automated, tool-supported approach for Web services instrumentation. We present a dual approach for efficiently instrumenting Web services. It consists of instrumenting the frontend Web services platform as well as the backend services. Although the instrumentation of the Web services platform necessarily is platform-specific, we have found a general, reusable approach. On the backend-side aspect-oriented programming techniques are successfully applied to instrument backend services. We present experimental studies of performance instrumentation using the application response measurement (ARM) API and evaluate the efficiency of the monitoring enhancements. Our results point the way to systematically gain better insights into the behaviour of Web services and thus how to build more dependable Web-based applications.}},

Traditionally, designers have relied on optimization techniques that require either prior knowledge or centrally managed runtime knowledge of the system's environment, but such techniques are not viable in dynamic networks where topology, resource, and node availability are subject to frequent and unpredictable change. To address this problem, we propose collaborative reinforcement learning (CRL) as a technique that enables groups of reinforcement learning agents to solve system optimization problems online in dynamic, decentralized networks. We evaluate an implementation of CRL in a routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks, called SAMPLE. Simulation results show how feedback in the selection of links by routing agents enables SAMPLE to adapt and optimize its routing behavior to varying network conditions and properties, resulting in optimization of network throughput. In the experiments, SAMPLE displays emergent properties such as traffic flows that exploit stable routes and reroute around areas of wireless interference or congestion. SAMPLE is an example of a complex adaptive distributed system.}},

However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from medical diagnosis, minefield detection, cluster recovery from noisy data, and spatial density estimation.

    abstract = {{Summary: There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.}},

Unit testing has received a lot of criticism in terms of the amount of time that it is perceived to take and its perceived costs. However it still remains an important verification activity being an effective means to test individual software components for boundary value behavior and ensure that all code has been exercised adequately. We examine the available data from three safety-related, industrial software projects that have made use of unit testing. Using this information we argue that the perceived costs of unit testing may be exaggerated and that the likely benefits in terms of defect detection are quite high in relation to those costs.
We also discuss the different issues that have been found applying the technique at different phases of the development and using different methods to generate those tests.

Using data that follows states over time allows economists to hold constant a host of potentially confounding factors that might contaminate an assignment of cause and effect. A good example is a fascinating paper by Donohue and Levitt (2001, henceforth DL), which purports to show that hypothetical individuals resulting from aborted fetuses, had they been born and developed into youths, would have been more likely to commit crimes than youths resulting from fetuses carried to term. We revisit that paper, showing that the actual implementation of DL's statistical test in their paper differed from what was described. (Specifically, controls for state-year effects were left out of their regression model.) We show that when DL's key test is run as described and augmented with state-level population data, evidence for higher per capita criminal propensities among the youths who would have developed, had they not been aborted as fetuses, vanishes. Two lessons for empirical researchers are, first, that controls may impact results in ways that are hard to predict, and second, that these controls are probably not powerful enough to compensate for the omission of a key variable in the regression model.

One technique that has received some attention for automatically composing workflows is AI-based classical planning. However, workflows generated by classical planning algorithms suffer from the paradoxical assumption of deterministic behavior of Web services, then requiring the additional overhead of execution monitoring to recover from unexpected behavior of services due to service failures, and the dynamic nature of real-world environments. To address these concerns, we propose using Markov decision processes (MDPs) to model workflow composition. To account for the uncertainty over the true environmental model, and for dynamic environments, we interleave MDP-based workflow generation and Bayesian model learning. Consequently, our method models both the inherent stochastic nature of Web services and the dynamic nature of the environment. Our algorithm produces workflows that are robust to non-deterministic behaviors of Web services and that adapt to a changing environment. We use a supply chain scenario to demonstrate our method and provide empirical results.}},

They solve this problem with a Multiple Choice knapsack algorithm. In my opinion, the whole graph does not have to be expanded, because if each service monitors its QoS metrics, we don't care about the individual services that are used internally.

    abstract = {{The paradigmatic shift from a Web of manual interactions to a Web of programmatic interactions driven by Web services is creating unprecedented opportunities for the formation of online business-to-business (B2B) collaborations. In particular, the creation of value-added services by composition of existing ones is gaining a significant momentum. Since many available Web services provide overlapping or identical functionality, albeit with different quality of service (QoS), a choice needs to be made to determine which services are to participate in a given composite service. This paper presents a middleware platform which addresses the issue of selecting Web services for the purpose of their composition in a way that maximizes user satisfaction expressed as utility functions over QoS attributes, while satisfying the constraints set by the user and by the structure of the composite service. Two selection approaches are described and compared: one based on local (task-level) selection of services and the other based on global allocation of tasks to services using integer programming.}},

Those users may have different and varying quality-of-service requirements that have to be considered for an appropriate distribution and installation of service components. The service also has to scale to thousands of administrative domains hosting those components. AspectIX is a novel middleware architecture which extends CORBA by a partitioned object model. A globally distributed service can be completely encapsulated into a single distributed object which contains not only all necessary components for scalability (e.g., caches and replicas) but also the knowledge for self-organization and distribution of the service. For distribution and installation of components, the service considers object-external policies to achieve administrative scalability.}},

    abstract = {{QoS (quality of service) support in Web services is an important issue since it ensures service usability and utility for each client and, in addition, improves server utilization. In this article, we present a QoS-capable Web service architecture, QCWS, by introducing a QoS broker module between service clients and providers (servers). The functions of the QoS broker module include tracking QoS information about servers, making selection decisions for clients, and negotiating with servers to get QoS agreements. We study two resource allocation algorithms (HQ and RQ) used by QoS brokers acting as the front-end of servers. The goals of the algorithms are to maximize the server resource usage while minimizing the QoS instability for each client. The first algorithm, HQ, assigns a homogeneous service level to all clients on the system and adjusts the service level according to the number of active clients. The second algorithm, RQ, assigns different service levels to clients according to their needs. Both algorithms try to minimize the resource reallocations for existing clients. The QoS performance and instability trade-offs are studied by simulation.}},

---=note-separator=---
(private-note)This article is interesting wrt the proposed algorithm. However, it does not allow for QoS value evaporation which may lead to sub-optimal service usage, because a service may improve/worsens over time. Also, +/- feedback can be sent to the service provider which he might use to evaluate his non-functional service parameters. A client could send his expected QoS parameters (based on past experience) to the service provider upon which he may decide to reject the request. This has the advantage of not having a central negotiator and it would fit quite nicely into the ranking of services. The client may decide to select the next ranked service.

Pros:
Cons:
---=note-separator=---
(private-note)Is resource allocation on the server a realistic model? Or does it make sense to execute in an best-effort and evaluate the feedback immediately? If the ranking service is used to select the best suitable service, the Web Service invocation can be extended with Header information that includes the expected QoS parameters. If the server cannot deliver, it will just reject the invocation and thereby allow a fast switch to the next ranked service. Otherwise, if no ranking is used, the service invocation is performed without any modifications to the execution flow.

(private-note)Test clients for performance studies can be modelled around real-world usage patterns to simulate high load at certain hours.

    abstract = {{Web service adaptation is an important feature for mission critical Web services. It is widely recognized that thrashing and crashes occur in system saturation for many statically adaptive resource management algorithms, including CPU, memory, and network congestion. Service adaptation supports alternative responses to saturation control, maintaining service and server system stability and progress, instead of thrashing. In this article, we present a design framework for developing adaptive Web services. The core of this framework is the adaptation space model, which is based on the concepts of adaptation space and adaptation case. An adaptation space is defined by a reference context and a partial order of adaptation cases. Each adaptation case describes a specific adaptation of a program or component of a Web service. We evaluate the adaptation space approach using Ginga, an adaptive query processing service for handling queries over multiple data sources with diverse capabilities across the Internet. Our experimental results show that Ginga query adaptation can achieve significant performance improvements (up to 40\% of response time gain) for processing distributed queries over the Internet in the presence of end-to-end delays.}},

    comment = {(private-note)The examples given in the motivation section exemplify the online adaptation (eager). However, it is not clear to me, whether this improves the performance, because it adds up the execution times and coordination time of the adaptation case. I wonder whether the lazy approach to adaptation improves the performance in so far, as the execution is not interrupted and maintained in a best attempt while recording (feedback) the experience and using it for future invocations. 
---=note-separator=---
(private-note)The model for adaptation competes with my ideas on using a bayesian network to model the ranking of deployed workflows. This ranking is as well based on QoS parameters.
The model, however, is interesting indeed and could serve as an evaluation criteria in future related work.
---=note-separator=---
(private-note)The adaptation case is superior compared to what we have in the DBE. At the moment we do not support modelling of QoS/SLA parameters. The state of those parameters can be optional or mandatory. In a bayesian approach we need means of evaluation QoS parameters automatically, i.e., in order to set up the causal relationship between those. Also, the notion of comparable (equivalent), overlapping, covering, or disjoint QoS is important to keep in mind.},

    abstract = {{This paper presents the architecture of a novel Peer to Peer (P2P) workflow management system. The proposed P2P architecture is based on concepts such as a Web Workflow Peers Directory (WWPD) and Web Workflow Peer (WWP). The WWPD is an active directory system that maintains a list of all peers (WWPs) that are available to participate in Web workflow processes. Similar to P2P systems such as Napster and Gnutella, it allows peers to register with the system and offer their services and resources to other peers over the Internet. Furthermore, the architecture supports a novel notification mechanism to facilitate distributed workflow administration and management.Employing P2P principles can potentially simplify the workflow process and provide a more open, scalable process model that is shared by all workflow participants. This would enable for example a WWP to connect directly to another without going through an intermediary, currently represented by the workflow process management server. P2P workflow becomes more efficient as the number of peers performing the same role increases. Available peers can be discovered dynamically from the WWPD.The few currently existing P2P based workflow systems fail to utilise state of the art Web technologies such as Web Services. In contrast, using the approach described here it is possible to expose interoperable workflow processes over the Internet as services. A medical consultation case study is used to demonstrate the proposed system.}},

Since they are based on message exchanges on the Internet, there are always security risks as messages could be stolen, lost, or modified. Fortunately there are security standards such as SSL, and emerging standards such as XML digital signatures. With these technologies, safe information exchange among trading partners can be ensured. On the other hand, there exist security architectures within enterprise environments that are recipient of the incoming messages. Therefore, we must concern how the security information accompanying incoming messages should be processed there. In this paper, we review security information items coming with SOAP (Simple Object Accessing Protocol) messages, and discuss how each item can be processed by constructs in enterprise systems. In our analysis, we consider alternate mappings, and evaluate their advantages in terms of performance and manageability}},

However, these schemas seldom address security issues, which can lead to a worst-case scenario of systems and protocols with no security at all. At best, they confine security to transport level mechanisms such as secure sockets layer (SSL). On the other hand, the omission of security provisions from domain schemas opens the way for generic security specifications based on XML document and grammar extensions. These specifications are orthogonal to domain schemas but integrate with them to support a variety of security objectives, such as confidentiality, integrity, and access control. In 2002, several specifications progressed toward providing a comprehensive standards framework for secure XML-based applications. The paper shows some of the most important specifications, the issues they address, and their dependencies.}},

@article{citeulike:117236,
    abstract = {{In the new AI of the 90s an important stream is artificial social intelligence. In this work basic ontological categories for social action, structure, and mind are introduced. Sociality (social action, social structure) is let emerge from the action and intelligence of individual agents in a common world. Also some aspects of the way-down—how emergent collective phenomena shape the individual mind—are examined. First, interference and dependence are defined, and then different kinds of coordination (reactive versus anticipatory; unilateral versus bilateral; selfish versus collaborative) are characterised.  ” Weak social action”, based on beliefs about the mind of the other agents, and  ” strong social action”, based on goals about others' minds and their actions, are distinguished. Special attention is paid to Goal Delegation and Goal Adoption that are considered as the basic ingredients of social commitment and contract, and then of exchange, cooperation, group action, and organisation. Different levels of delegation and then of autonomy of the delegated agent are described; and different levels of goal-adoption are shown to characterise true collaboration. Social goals in the minds of the group members are argued to be the real glue of joint activity, and the notion of social commitment, as different from individual and from collective commitment, is underlined. The necessity for modelling social objective structures and constraints is emphasised and the  ” shared mind” view of groups and organisations is criticised. The spontaneous and unaware emergence of a dependence structure is explained, as well as its feedback on the participants' minds and behaviours. Critical observations are presented on current confusions such as that between  ” social” and  ” collective” action, or between communication and social action. The main claims of the paper are the following: (a) The real foundation of all sociality (cooperation, competition, groups, organisation, etc.) is the individual social action and mind. One cannot reduce or connect action at the collective level to action at the individual level unless one passes through the social character of the individual action, (b) Important levels of coordination and cooperation necessarily require minds and cognitive agents (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). (c) However, cognition, communication and agreement are not enough for modelling and implementing cooperation: emergent pre-cognitive structures and constraints should be formalised, and emergent forms of cooperation are needed also among planning and deliberative agents, (d) We are going towards a synthetic paradigm in AI and Cognitive Science, reconciling situatedness and plans, reactivity and mental representations, cognition, emergence and self-organisation.}},

problem of ensuring that the derived group decision is in accord with the
collective's intention. In modern systems, political institutions have
instatiated representative forms of decision-making to ensure that every

behavior of the whole--even if only indirectly through representation. An
agent-based simulation demonstrates that in modern representative systems, as
the ratio of representatives increases, there exists an exponential decrease in
the ability for the group to behave in accord with the desires of the whole. To
remedy this issue, this paper provides a novel representative power structure
for decision-making that utilizes a social network and power distribution
algorithm to maintain the collective's perspective over varying degrees of
participation and/or ratios of representation. This work shows promise for the
future development of policy-making systems that are supported by the computer

    abstract = {{Many multi-agent systems consist of a complex network of autonomous yet interdependent agents. Examples of such networked multi-agent systems include supply chains and sensor networks. In these systems, agents have a select set of other agents with whom they interact based on environmental knowledge, cognitive capabilities, resource limitations, and communications constraints. Previous findings have demonstrated that the structure of the artificial social network governing the agent interactions is strongly correlated with organizational performance. As multi-agent systems are typically embedded in dynamic environments, we wish to develop distributed, on-line network adaptation mechanisms for discovering effective network structures. Therefore, within the context of dynamic team formation, we propose several strategies for agent-organized networks (AONs) and evaluate their effectiveness for increasing organizational performance.}},

@book{citeulike:142436,
    abstract = {{<I>Peer-to-Peer</I> is a book about an emerging idea. That idea is that the traditional model of participating in the Internet, in which a small computer operated by an everyday user (a "client") asks for and receives information from a big computer administered by a corporation or other large entity (a "server"), is beginning to give some ground to a new (new to the fringes of the Internet, anyway) model called peer-to-peer networking. In peer-to-peer networking, all participants in a network are approximately equal. Furthermore, the participants are usually ordinary computers run by everyday people. The ICQ chat service and the Napster music-sharing community are examples of what this book is about.<p>  The chief advantage of peer-to-peer networks is that large numbers of people share the burden of providing computing resources (processor time and disk space), administration effort, creativity, and--in more than a few cases--legal liability. Furthermore, it's relatively easy to be anonymous in such an environment, and it's harder for opponents of your peer-to-peer service to bring it down. The primary disadvantage of peer-to-peer systems, as anyone will attest who's had an MP3 download prematurely terminated when a dialup user went offline will attest, is the tendency of computers at the edge of the network to fade in and out of availability. Accountability for the actions of network participants is a potential problem, too. <p>  This is a book about the idea of equipping ordinary Internet users' computers with mechanisms that enable them to connect, more or less automatically and without human attention, to other everyday Internet users' machines. By forming networks of computers at the so-called "edge" of the Internet, it's possible to offer valuable services without the burden of building and administering large, centralized computer systems of the sort that host traditional Web sites. Napster is the most successful example to date, though nerds will note that it's not a completely peer-to-peer system because users register their file libraries with a central server when they log on to the service.<p>  Don't approach this book expecting to learn how to build the next Napster system. It's not a how-to book. It's not even much of a why-to book. Rather, it's a book that aims to get its readers thinking about what happens when information systems shift away from the client-server model and toward the peer-to-peer model (that's one of the book's points, by the way, that this is not a one-or-the-other architectural decision). <p>  Mostly, <I>Peer-to-Peer</I> makes its point by letting experts in peer-to-peer take turns in the spotlight. Any other approach would be kind of ironic, wouldn't it? In any case, David Anderson explains how SETI@home puts space buffs' idle computing cycles to use in analyzing radio noise from outer space. Gene Kan explains how Gnutella (a truly serverless environment) works. The architects of Publius explain how distributed computing is especially resistant to censorship and denial-of-service attacks. Other contributors discuss peer-to-peer chat software, anonymous remailing services, and other applications of peer-to-peer design.<p>  There's no one from Napster represented as an author in this collection of essays, but Clay Shirky presents an essay called "Listening to Napster." In that essay, Shirky gives an opinion on why Napster has succeeded: It focused on providing something consumers wanted, and bypassed Internet conventions (like the Domain Naming System) because they weren't the best way to provide the service. This is not an earth-shattering revelation, but it's true, and it's something developers of any new service (Internet-based or otherwise) need to keep in mind.<p>  Some of the technical proposals presented here will get readers thinking. An example: Require that senders of e-mail solve a moderately complex math problem before recipients' mailboxes will accept their mail. The problem would be no big deal for a mailer to solve if he or she were sending messages one at a time, but the processor load would really add up for spammers who blast tens of thousands of unwanted emails onto the Internet in a single session. Another idea: mechanizing the concept of reputation so people know whose thoughts and whose creative works (like software) are worth using or believing. <p>  More business-oriented readers might want to read more about the more subtle ways of incorporating peer-to-peer components into business models. Lots of traditional Web services--Amazon.com is an example--are supplementing their client-server activities with others that have peer-to-peer characteristics. Amazon.com, for example, lets operators of small Web sites promote goods and rely on the centralized resources for billing and fulfillment. There's no distributed software (other than a few links), but the company takes advantage of creativity and marketing efforts outside of its official core. Coverage of that sort of "soft" distributed computing might be a good supplement for the second edition of this book.<p>  <I>Peer-to-Peer</I> is a thought-provoking book that will help its readers understand an exciting, still-emerging application architecture for the Internet. <I>--David Wall</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Peer-to-peer applications that run at the edges of the Internet, usually on home computers run by ordinary people. Much of this book comprises case studies on SETI@home, Gnutella, Freenet, Jabber, and other peer-to-peer services. Later chapters address technical issues, such as accountability, security, efficient use of limited bandwidth, and data cataloging.  } {The term "peer-to-peer" has come to be applied to networks that  expect end users to contribute their own files, computing time, or  other resources to some shared project. Even more interesting than  the technology's technical underpinnings is its socially disruptive  potential: in various ways these systems return content, choice, and  control to ordinary users.  This book presents the goals that drive the  developers of the best-known peer-to-peer systems, the problems  they've faced, and the technical solutions they've found. The  contributors are leading developers of well-known peer-to-peer  systems, including Popular Power, Jabber, Gnutella, FreeNet,  SETI@Home, Red Rover, Publius, Free Haven, and Groove Networks.  Topics include the Internet as a collection of conversations, metadata,  performance, trust, accountability, security, and gateways between  systems.}},

    abstract = {{Distributed computer architectures labeled "peer-to-peer" are designed for the sharing of computer resources (content, storage, CPU cycles) by direct exchange, rather than requiring the intermediation or support of a centralized server or authority. Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.}},

    abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to propose a new approach for the supply chain management. This approach is based on the virtual enterprise paradigm and the usage of multi-agent concept. The base component of our approach is a virtual enterprise node (VEN). The supply chain is viewed as a set of tiers (corresponding to the levels of production), in which each partner of the supply chain (VEN) is in relation with several customers and suppliers. Each VEN belongs to one tier. The main customer gives global objectives (quantity, cost and delay) to the supply chain. The mediator agent (MA) is in charge to manage the supply chain in order to respect those objectives as global level. Those objectives are taking over to negotiator agent at the tier level (NAT). This architecture allows supply chains management which is completely transparent seen from simple enterprise of the supply chain. The use of multi-agent system allows physical distribution of the decisional system. Moreover, the hierarchical organizational structure with a decentralized control guarantees, at the same time, the autonomy of each entity and the whole flexibility.}},

    abstract = {{Cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources.}},

Furthermore, settings in which agents lack sufficient knowledge of the capabilities of potential partners is rarely, if ever, touched upon. We remove these often unrealistic assumptions and propose a model that utilizes Bayesian (multiagent) reinforcement learning in a way that enables coalition participants to reduce their uncertainty regarding coalitional values and the capabilities of others. In addition, we introduce the Bayesian Core, a new stability concept for coalition formation under uncertainty. Preliminary experimental evidence demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.}},

    abstract = {{Creating Web processes using Web service technology gives us the opportunity for selecting new services which best suit our need at the moment. Doing this automatically would require us to quantify our criteria for selection. In addition, there are challenging issues of correctness and optimality. We present a Constraint Driven Web Service Composition tool in METEOR-S, which allows the process designers to bind Web Services to an abstract process, based on business and process constraints and generate an executable process. Our approach is to reduce much of the service composition problem to a constraint satisfaction problem. It uses a multi-phase approach for constraint analysis. This work was done as part of the METEOR-S framework, which aims to support the complete lifecycle of semantic Web processes.}},

    abstract = {{The Web is evolving from a repository for text and images to a service provider-including information-providing services and services that have some effect on the world. Furthermore, today's Web was designed primarily for human use, but we are seeing increased automation of Web service interoperation, primarily in B2B and E-Commerce applications. Fundamental to reliable, large-scale interoperation of services by computer programs or agents is the need to make Web service properties, capabilities, interfaces, and effects understandable to computers-to create Semantic Web Services. In this article, the authors propose a vision and a partial realization of precisely this. They propose markup of Web services in the DAML family of semantic Web markup languages. Their markup of Web services enables a wide variety of agent technologies for automated Web service discovery, execution, composition, and interoperation. They present one logic-based agent technology for service composition, predicated on the use of reusable, task-specific, high-level generic procedures and user-specific customizing constraints.}},

Self-Serv adopts the principle that every service, whether elementary or composite, should provide a programmatic interface based on SOAP and the Web Service Definition Language. This does not exclude the possibility of integrating legacy applications, such as those written in CORBA, into the service's business logic. To integrate such applications, however, first requires the development of appropriate adapters. The paper considers how the mechanism for composing services in Self-Serv is based on two major concepts: the composite service and the service container.}},

In the second part of the article a number of applications of ACO algorithms to combinatorial optimization and routing in communications networks are described.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that most large networks for which topological information is available display scale-free features. Here we study the scaling properties of the recently introduced scale-free model, that can account for the observed power-law distribution of the connectivities. We develop a mean-field method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual vertices, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The mean-field method can be used to address the properties of two variants of the scale-free model, that do not display power-law scaling.}},

    abstract = {{As computer networks increase in size, become more heterogeneous and span greater geographic distances, applications must be designed to cope with the very large scale, poor reliability, and often, with the extreme dynamism of the underlying network.  Aggregation  is a key functional building block for such applications: it refers to a set of functions that provide components of a distributed system access to global information including network size, average load, average uptime, location and description of hotspots, and so on. Local access to global information is often very useful, if not indispensable for building applications that are robust and adaptive. For example, in an industrial control application, some aggregate value reaching a threshold may trigger the execution of certain actions; a distributed storage system will want to know the total available free space; load-balancing protocols may benefit from knowing the target average load so as to minimize the load they transfer. We propose a gossip-based protocol for computing aggregate values over network components in a fully decentralized fashion. The class of aggregate functions we can compute is very broad and includes many useful special cases such as counting, averages, sums, products, and extremal values. The protocol is suitable for extremely large and highly dynamic systems due to its proactive structure---all nodes receive the aggregate value continuously, thus being able to track any changes in the system. The protocol is also extremely lightweight, making it suitable for many distributed applications including peer-to-peer and grid computing systems. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our gossip-based protocol both theoretically and experimentally under a variety of scenarios including node and communication failures.}},

However, the problems associated with this paradigm are manifold. Here some of these problems will be highlighted and briefly critiqued. lsquoThermoeconomicsrsquo, by contrast, is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood not in terms of the Second Law but in terms of such economic criteria as lsquoproductivityrsquo, lsquoefficiencyrsquo, and especially the costs and benefits (or lsquoprofitabilityrsquo) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work. Thus thermoeconomics is fully consistent with the Darwinian paradigm. Economic criteria provide a better account of the advances (and recessions) in bioenergetic technologies than does any formulation derived from the Second Law.}},

This state-of-the-art survey systematically draws together prerequisites from various fields, presents techniques and methodologies in a principled and coherent way, and gives a comprehensive overview on the manifold applications of the peer-to-peer paradigm. Leading researchers contributed their expert knowledge to this book, each in his/her own specific area. Lecturers can choose from the wide range of 32 tightly integrated chapters on all current aspects of P2P systems and applications, and thus individually tailor their class syllabi.

turn divide, roughly, into tools for analyzing data, tools for constructing and
evaluating models, and tools for measuring complexity. I discuss the principles
of statistical learning and model selection; time series analysis; cellular

However, despite the key role of these networks in sustaining cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present a systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variation in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks have the same topological scaling properties and show striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems2. This may indicate that metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but also complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks2, 3, 4, 5, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.}},

We show that these two features are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that small groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks, the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the Worldwideweb, actor network, the Internet at the domain level, and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems.}},

    abstract = {{Modern science has been built on a Cartesian or Newtonian (mechanical) world view giving rise to an artifactual view of mind and suggesting that particles (learners) are continuously working to destroy order (are recalcitrant), which can only be maintained by an external artificer (the teacher). At the core of the Cartesian worldview is the absolute separation of mind and matter. Beginning with the separation of mind and body, Cartesianism is grounded in a set of dualisms that separate individual from environment and leads to the belief that knowledge refers to a self-sufficient immaterial substance that can be understood independently from the individual, environment, and context in which it is situated. In contrast, we make the argument for an alternative set of assumptions predicated on a relational ontology and grounded in recent developments in the understanding of self-organizing systems. In our view, knowing, meaning, and cognition are actualized through the dynamic between learner (self) and environment (nonself), and that which is neither the learner nor the environment. We further argue that the ecologized, or self-organization, model (relational ontology) establishes that (under the appropriate conditions) the particles (learners), in effect, "want" to or strive opportunistically to order themselves once the intention has been properly initialized. From this perspective, instruction involves establishing the appropriate field conditions or connecting the learner into a system (a set of relations) through participation (e.g., as part of a community of practice) in the service of an intention. The type of learning that we are advocating cannot be handed to the learner wholecloth but develops itself through dynamic activity (participation) as part of a system as a whole. Central to this line of reasoning is the assertion not only that learner practices and meaningful relations that arise due to their functional significance as part of a dynamic system are fundamentally different from teacher- or text-book-owned descriptions of practices and meanings, but that they are in this way far richer, more meaningful, and more functional. Context and participation, to put it directly, not only matter but in a deep and fundamental way are everything.}},

However, this multiagent system paradigm introduces a number of new abstractions and design/development issues when compared with more traditional approaches to software development. Accordingly, new analysis and design methodologies, as well as new tools, are needed to effectively engineer such systems. Against this background, the contribution of this article is twofold. First, we synthesize and clarify the key abstractions of agent-based computing as they pertain to agent-oriented software engineering. In particular, we argue that a multiagent system can naturally be viewed and architected as a computational organization, and we identify the appropriate organizational abstractions that are central to the analysis and design of such systems. Second, we detail and extend the Gaia methodology for the analysis and design of multiagent systems. Gaia exploits the aforementioned organizational abstractions to provide clear guidelines for the analysis and design of complex and open software systems. Two representative case studies are introduced to exemplify Gaia's concepts and to show its use and effectiveness in different types of multiagent system.}},

    abstract = {{Advanced technologies and biology have extremely different physical implementations, but they are far more alike in systems-level organization than is widely appreciated. Convergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

    abstract = {{
                Arguments for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity are weakened by the lack of an unambiguous definition of complexity. Such definitions abound for both dynamical systems and biological organisms, but have drawbacks of either a conceptual or a practical nature. Physical complexity, a measure based on automata theory and information theory, is a simple and intuitive measure of the amount of information that an organism stores, in its genome, about the environment in which it evolves. It is argued that physical complexity must increase in molecular evolution of asexual organisms in a single niche if the environment does not change, due to natural selection. It is possible that complexity decreases in co-evolving systems as well as at high mutation rates, in sexual populations, and in time-dependent landscapes. However, it is reasoned that these factors usually help, rather than hinder, the evolution of complexity, and that a theory of physical complexity for co-evolving species will reveal an overall trend towards higher complexity in biological evolution.

We detect characteristic network building blocks (structural and functional motifs) in neuroanatomical data sets and identify a small set of structural motifs that occur in significantly increased numbers. Our analysis suggests the hypothesis that brain networks maximize both the number and the diversity of functional motifs, while the repertoire of structural motifs remains small. Using functional motif number as a cost function in an optimization algorithm, we obtain network topologies that resemble real brain networks across a broad spectrum of structural measures, including small-world attributes. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that highly evolved neural architectures are organized to maximize functional repertoires and to support highly efficient integration of information.}},

We show that in both cases, the search time is minimum in the small-world regime, when an appropriate distance between the nodes is defined. Through an analytical model, we show that the search time scales as N(1/D(D+1)) for small-world networks, where N is the number of nodes and D is the dimension of the underlying lattice.

depends on highly reproducible dynamics of regulatory processes. Biological
information processing elements, however, are intrinsically noisy (genetic
switches, neurons, etc.). Such noise poses severe stability problems to system
behavior as it tends to desynchronize system dynamics (e.g. via fluctuating
response or transmission time of the elements). Synchronicity in parallel
information processing is not readily sustained in the absence of a central
clock. Here we analyze the influence of topology on synchronicity in networks
of autonomous noisy elements. In numerical and analytical studies we find a
clear distinction between non-reliable and reliable dynamical attractors,
depending on the topology of the circuit. In the reliable cases, synchronicity
is sustained, while in the unreliable scenario, fluctuating responses of single
elements can gradually desynchronize the system, leading to non-reproducible
behavior. We find that the fraction of reliable dynamical attractors strongly
correlates with the underlying circuitry. Our model suggests that the observed
motif structure of biological signaling networks is shaped by the biological
requirement for reproducibility of attractors.}},

    abstract = {{Many real-world networks describe systems in which interactions decay with the distance between nodes. Examples include systems constrained in real space such as transportation and communication networks, as well as systems constrained in abstract spaces such as multivariate biological or economic data sets and models of social networks. These networks often display network motifs: subgraphs that recur in the network much more often than in randomized networks. To understand the origin of the network motifs in these networks, it is important to study the subgraphs and network motifs that arise solely from geometric constraints. To address this, we analyze geometric network models, in which nodes are arranged on a lattice and edges are formed with a probability that decays with the distance between nodes. We present analytical solutions for the numbers of all three- and four-node subgraphs, in both directed and nondirected geometric networks. We also analyze geometric networks with arbitrary degree sequences and models with a bias for directed edges in one direction. Scaling rules for scaling of subgraph numbers with system size, lattice dimension, and interaction range are given. Several invariant measures are found, such as the ratio of feedback and feed-forward loops, which do not depend on system size, dimension, or connectivity function. We find that network motifs in many real-world networks, including social networks and neuronal networks, are not captured solely by these geometric models. This is in line with recent evidence that biological network motifs were selected as basic circuit elements with defined information-processing functions.}},

    abstract = {{Engineered systems are often built of recurring circuit modules that carry out key functions. Transcription networks that regulate the responses of living cells were recently found to obey similar principles: they contain several biochemical wiring patterns, termed network motifs, which recur throughout the network. One of these motifs is the feed-forward loop (FFL). The FFL, a three-gene pattern, is composed of two input transcription factors, one of which regulates the other, both jointly regulating a target gene. The FFL has eight possible structural types, because each of the three interactions in the FFL can be activating or repressing. Here, we theoretically analyze the functions of these eight structural types. We find that four of the FFL types, termed incoherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive accelerators: they speed up the response time of the target gene expression following stimulus steps in one direction (e.g., off to on) but not in the other direction (on to off). The other four types, coherent FFLs, act as sign-sensitive delays. We find that some FFL types appear in transcription network databases much more frequently than others. In some cases, the rare FFL types have reduced functionality (responding to only one of their two input stimuli), which may partially explain why they are selected against. Additional features, such as pulse generation and cooperativity, are discussed. This study defines the function of one of the most significant recurring circuit elements in transcription networks.}},

The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints.

                Complex networks are studied across many fields of science. To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.

                Agents in creative enterprises are embedded in networks that inspire, support, and evaluate their work. Here, we investigate how the mechanisms by which creative teams self-assemble determine the structure of these collaboration networks. We propose a model for the self-assembly of creative teams that has its basis in three parameters: team size, the fraction of newcomers in new productions, and the tendency of incumbents to repeat previous collaborations. The model suggests that the emergence of a large connected community of practitioners can be described as a phase transition. We find that team assembly mechanisms determine both the structure of the collaboration network and team performance for teams derived from both artistic and scientific fields.

Yet, the underlying reasons for the variable quantity of different subgraph types, their propensity to form clusters, and their relationship with the networks' global organization remain poorly understood. Here we show that a network's large-scale topological organization and its local subgraph structure mutually define and predict each other, as confirmed by direct measurements in five well studied cellular networks. We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs, the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The identified topological framework may have important implications for our understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks.}},

DeRose Jr. Hierarchical topology optimization is introduced as a mechanism to reduce computational resources needed to solve large scale, 3-dimensional problems. In hierarchical topology optimization, octree data structures are used to describe a given design during the optimization process. Using a sequence of hierarchically described models, increasingly detailed descriptions of the optimal shape are...}},

We introduce the art and science of genetic algorithms and survey current issues in GA theory and practice. We do not present a detailed study, instead, we offer a quick guide into the labyrinth of GA research. First, we draw the analogy between genetic algorithms and the search processes in nature. Then we describe the genetic algorithm that Holland introduced in 1975 and the workings of GAs. After a survey of techniques proposed as improvements to Holland's GA and of some radically different approaches, we survey the advances in GA theory related to modeling, dynamics, and deception.>}},

This is due to the importance of combinatorial optimization problems for the scientific as well as the industrial world. We give a survey of the nowadays most important metaheuristics from a conceptual point of view. We outline the different components and concepts that are used in the different metaheuristics in order to analyze their similarities and differences. Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I\&D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.}},

Here, we show that the metabolic networks of 43 distinct organisms are organized into many small, highly connected topologic modules that combine in a hierarchical manner into larger, less cohesive units, with their number and degree of clustering following a power law. Within Escherichia coli, the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions. The identified network architecture may be generic to system-level cellular organization.}},
